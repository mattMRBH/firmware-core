/**
 * AirGradient Go — Sensor Producer
 *
 * Wraps the shared SensorManager in an independent RTOS task.  The
 * orchestrator signals it (via task notification) to run a measurement cycle; the
 * task calls SensorManager::start_measures() — which blocks for the full
 * averaging duration — then posts a SensorDataReady event to the orchestrator
 * event queue.
 *
 * AGo sensor wiring (owned by main.cpp wiring layer, not by this class):
 *   sensors.temp_hum     = &sht40_driver
 *   sensors.co2          = &co2_driver       // S8 or Sunlight
 *   sensors.pms_a        = &pms5003_driver
 *   sensors.pms_b        = nullptr
 *   sensors.tvoc_nox     = &sgp41_driver
 *   sensors.o3_no2       = nullptr
 *
 * SensorProducer holds only a SensorManager reference.  It has no knowledge
 * of which sensors are wired — that is the product wiring layer's
 * responsibility.
