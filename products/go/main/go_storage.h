/**
 * AirGradient Go — Storage Service
 *
 * Two-tier storage management for the Go product:
 *
 * - Temporary (chart data): PayloadCache with RtcPayloadCacheStorage backend.
 *   Survives deep sleep (RTC memory); lost on power-off. Ring-buffer
 *   semantics — oldest entry is overwritten when the buffer is full.
 *
 * - Persistent (route data): POSIX file I/O on an FATFS filesystem provided
 *   by NandStorage. Survives power-off. One binary file per tracking session;
 *   route files are stored at <mount_path>/routes/route_NNNNN.bin, where
 *   NNNNN is the 5-digit session ID (10000–99999).
 *
 * No independent task — all methods are called synchronously by the
 * orchestrator.
