/**
 * AirGradient Go — Fuel-Gauge Learning Journal (persistent diagnostics)
 *
 * Append-only text log on the SPI-NAND FATFS mount. The learning run spans
 * ~1 day and many reboots / ship-cycles, so live serial is unreliable: every
 * event is appended to a file that survives power-off, and the whole file is
 * replayed to serial on each boot and at the terminal result. Connect serial
 * at any point — even at the Failed screen — and the full history prints.
 *
 * Writes are event-driven only (boots, stage transitions, learning-flag edges,
 * verify, ship, result) — never per-poll — so NAND wear stays trivial. Each
 * append is fsync'd so a sudden reset loses at most the in-flight record.
 * Target-only — never host-compiled.
