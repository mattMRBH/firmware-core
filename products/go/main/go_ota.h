/**
 * AirGradient Go — OTA Service
 *
 * Product-side glue around the airgradient-ota component.  Owns the per-mode
 * OTA wiring: BLE push (Portable) on the borrowed AgBleServer and WiFi pull
 * (Stationary) over a per-call OtaUpdater.  Both transports terminate at the
 * owned EspOtaImageWriter.  The orchestrator drives every entry point on its
 * own task; OtaService never spawns a task and never reboots — it returns an
 * OtaStatus and the orchestrator decides.
 *
 * Foreground / exclusive model: OtaBleService::run() and OtaUpdater::run() are
 * single blocking calls invoked from the orchestrator's OTA poll, after the
 * orchestrator has quiesced every other service.  See products/go/specs/ota.md.
