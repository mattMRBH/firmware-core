## 1. Discovery and Connection

### Advertised Name

The device advertises as **`AirGradient Go <suffix>`** where `<suffix>` is the
last four lowercase hex chars of the device serial (the bottom two bytes of
the device's Wi-Fi MAC address).

Example: MAC `aa:bb:cc:dd:ef:0e` advertises as `AirGradient Go ef0e`.

The total advertised name is 19 characters. The suffix provides ~65 000
distinct values, which is sufficient to disambiguate multiple devices in the
same household; collisions are possible in larger fleets, so clients should
not treat the suffix as a globally unique identifier — use the BLE address
or the device's reported serial for that purpose.

### Advertised Service UUID

The 128-bit service UUID is included in the advertising payload:

```text
d1c0c0a0-6b48-4b2a-9b1d-59f9f2b0a1e1
```

The complete local name is placed in the scan response data.

### Scanning Recommendations

- **Preferred**: filter by the service UUID above for reliable discovery.
  This is robust to future name format changes.
- **Fallback**: filter by name prefix `"AirGradient Go "` (note the trailing
  space).
- The device supports a single concurrent connection. While a client is
  connected, the device stops advertising. Advertising resumes after
  disconnect.

### Connection Parameters

The device is a BLE peripheral (Broadcaster + Peripheral roles). It does not
initiate connections.

---

## 2. Pairing and Security

### Pairing Model

The device uses **Passkey Entry** pairing with **Display Only** IO capability.
The device generates and displays a 6-digit numeric passkey (000000–999999)
on its e-paper screen. The user must enter this passkey on the phone to
complete pairing.

Security features:

- **Bonding**: Enabled. After successful pairing, the bond is stored and
  subsequent connections skip passkey entry.
- **MITM protection**: Enabled.

### Pairing Flow

```text
Phone                              Device
  |                                  |
  |------- connect ----------------->|
  |                                  |
  |------- initiate pairing -------->|
  |                                  |
  |                         (generates passkey)
  |                         (shows passkey on display)
  |                                  |
  |  (user reads passkey from device)|
  |                                  |
  |------- enter passkey ----------->|
  |                                  |
  |<------- pairing complete --------|
  |                                  |
  |  (bonded — future connections    |
  |   skip passkey entry)            |
```

### Authenticated Characteristics

When security is enabled (production builds), the following characteristics
require an authenticated (paired) connection:

| Characteristic | Read | Write | Notify / Subscribe |
|---|---|---|---|
| Measures | Authenticated | — | Authenticated |
| Status | Authenticated | — | — |
| Config | Authenticated | Authenticated | — |
| History | — | Authenticated | — |
| Wi-Fi Scan (provisioning) | — | Encrypted | Encrypted |
| Credentials/Status (provisioning) | Encrypted | Encrypted | Encrypted |
| Device Information (DIS) | Encrypted | — | — |

The provisioning and DIS characteristics require an **encrypted** link rather
than an explicitly authenticated one. On the Portable link the bonded MITM
pairing above already provides encryption, so no extra step is needed (see §9
and §10).

Attempting to read or subscribe to an authenticated characteristic without
pairing will usually trigger the BLE stack's pairing flow automatically on
supported platforms.

### Development Builds

Development firmware may disable BLE security. In this case, all
characteristics are accessible without pairing. The GATT structure remains
identical.

## 3. GATT Service Overview

### Service

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| UUID | `d1c0c0a0-6b48-4b2a-9b1d-59f9f2b0a1e1` |
| Type | Primary Service |

### Characteristics

| Name | UUID | Properties | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Measures | `d1c0c0a1-...` | Read, Notify | Live sensor + GPS data |
| Status | `d1c0c0a2-...` | Read, Notify | Device status snapshot |
| Config | `d1c0c0a3-...` | Read, Write, Notify | Get/set config, execute commands |
| History | `d1c0c0a4-...` | Write, Notify | Stored route data export |

All UUIDs share the base `d1c0c0aX-6b48-4b2a-9b1d-59f9f2b0a1e1` where `X`
is the characteristic index (1–4).

When BLE security is enabled, the Measures characteristic requires an
authenticated connection for both read access and notification delivery.

### Additional Services (Portable mode)

In Portable mode the bonded link also exposes two more services — alongside the
AGo data service above — for Wi-Fi provisioning and device identity:

| Service | UUID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| AirGradient Provisioning | `acbcfea8-e541-4c40-9bfd-17820f16c95c` | Wi-Fi scan + credentials + live status (§10) |
| Device Information (DIS) | `0x180A` | Model / Serial / Firmware / Manufacturer (§9) |

Neither UUID is added to the advertising payload (the client is already
connected on the bonded link); discover them via GATT service discovery after
connecting.

---

## 4. Serialization

All characteristic payloads use **CBOR** (RFC 8949, Concise Binary Object
Representation). CBOR is a compact binary encoding similar to JSON in
structure.

### Conventions

- **Map keys**: Short lowercase ASCII strings (e.g., `"t"`, `"pm25"`,
  `"co2"`).
- **Missing keys**: If a sensor reading is unavailable or invalid, the key
  is omitted entirely. A missing key means "data not available" — not zero.
- **Numeric types**:
  - Unsigned integers (`uint`): CO2, TVOC, NOx, timestamps, counts.
  - Float32 (`float`): Temperature, humidity, PM, pressure, altitude.
  - Float64 (`double`): GPS latitude and longitude (for precision).
  - Boolean: Config toggles, tracking state.
  - Text string: Enum values (charging state, GPS mode, etc.).

### Payload Sizes

All payloads fit within a single BLE notification (max ~253 bytes at standard
MTU). No application-level fragmentation is needed for CBOR payloads.

| Characteristic | Typical Size | Max Size |
|---|---|---|
| Measures | ~120 B | ~135 B |
| Status | ~95 B | ~115 B |
| Config (read) | ~135 B | ~170 B |
| Config (notify) | ~150 B | ~183 B |

## 5. Measures Characteristic

**UUID**: `d1c0c0a1-6b48-4b2a-9b1d-59f9f2b0a1e1`
**Properties**: Read, Notify
**Direction**: Device -> Phone

### Read

Read this characteristic at any time to get the latest sensor measurements.
The device updates the characteristic value on every measurement cycle
regardless of connection state, so a phone can read immediately after
connecting without waiting for the first notification.

### Subscription

Subscribe to notifications on this characteristic to receive live sensor
data. The device sends a notification each time a new measurement cycle
completes (typically every few seconds, configurable via Config).

In production builds, both reads and subscription require an authenticated
(paired) connection. If the client reads or enables notifications before
pairing, the BLE stack may trigger the passkey pairing flow automatically.

Notifications are only sent while the device is in **Portable** operating
mode and the BLE client is connected.

### Payload

CBOR map. All keys are optional except `"ts"`.

| Key | Type | Unit | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"t"` | float32 | Celsius | Temperature |
| `"h"` | float32 | % | Relative humidity |
| `"pm1"` | float32 | ug/m3 | PM 1.0 |
| `"pm25"` | float32 | ug/m3 | PM 2.5 |
| `"pm10"` | float32 | ug/m3 | PM 10 |
| `"co2"` | uint | ppm | CO2 concentration |
| `"tvoc"` | uint | index | TVOC index (1–500) |
| `"nox"` | uint | index | NOx index (1–500) |
| `"pres"` | float32 | hPa | Atmospheric pressure |
| `"lat"` | float64 | degrees | GPS latitude |
| `"lon"` | float64 | degrees | GPS longitude |
| `"alt"` | float32 | meters MSL | GPS altitude |
| `"fix"` | uint | enum | GPS fix type: 0=none, 2=2D, 3=3D |
| `"sat"` | uint | count | Satellite count |
| `"ts"` | uint | unix seconds | Measurement timestamp (**always present**) |

### GPS Field Rules

GPS fields (`"lat"`, `"lon"`, `"alt"`, `"fix"`, `"sat"`) are only included
when the device has a valid GPS fix. If the device is idle (not tracking) or
has no GPS fix, all GPS keys are absent.

When GPS is included:

- `"fix"` and `"sat"` are always present in the group.
- `"lat"`, `"lon"`, `"alt"` are individually omitted if that specific
  reading is invalid.

### Examples

**All sensors active, GPS has 3D fix:**

```json
{
  "t": 23.5, "h": 45.2,
  "pm1": 5.0, "pm25": 8.3, "pm10": 12.1,
  "co2": 450, "tvoc": 120, "nox": 5,
  "pres": 1013.2,
  "lat": 47.376887, "lon": 8.541694, "alt": 408.0,
  "fix": 3, "sat": 12,
  "ts": 1711234567
}
```

**Idle, CO2 sensor warming up:**

```json
{
  "t": 23.5, "h": 45.2,
  "pm1": 5.0, "pm25": 8.3, "pm10": 12.1,
  "tvoc": 120, "nox": 5,
  "pres": 1013.2,
  "ts": 1711234567
}
```

GPS keys absent (not tracking). `"co2"` key absent (sensor not ready).

## 6. Status Characteristic

**UUID**: `d1c0c0a2-6b48-4b2a-9b1d-59f9f2b0a1e1`
**Properties**: Read, Notify
**Direction**: Device -> Phone

### Usage

Read this characteristic at any time to get a snapshot of the device's
current status. The device refreshes the value internally on battery
polls, GPS fix changes, history-delete reconciliation, and on every
tracking state transition.

### Notifications

Subscribe to receive an immediate push on **urgent transitions**. The device
fires NOTIFY only for the events listed below — _not_ on every periodic Status
refresh. Clients that want live GPS / flash-usage in between should keep polling
via Read (see [Polling the non-urgent fields](#polling-the-non-urgent-fields)).

A Status **NOTIFY carries only a delta** — never the full snapshot. There are
**two delta shapes**, distinguished by which keys are present (there is **no**
`"type"` discriminator on Status notifications):

- **Tracking transition** — `{"tracking": <bool>, "session": <uint>}`.
- **Charging transition** — `{"charging": <text>, "bat_pct": <uint>, "bat_v":
  <float32>}`, pushed when the user plugs in, unplugs, or the battery finishes
  charging.

The two shapes have **disjoint keys**, so just **merge whichever keys arrive**
into your local model. A notification is a single ATT PDU and is kept bounded by
sending only what changed. The **Read** value remains the full 9-key snapshot
(see Payload); re-read Status for the full state on connect.

| Event | NOTIFY? | Payload reflects |
|---|---|---|
| `start_tracking` succeeded | Yes | `tracking: true`, `session: N` |
| `start_tracking` failed at storage open | Yes | `tracking: false`, `session: 0` |
| `stop_tracking` (manual) | Yes | `tracking: false`, `session: 0` |
| Charging transition (plug in / unplug / charge complete) | Yes | `charging`, `bat_pct`, `bat_v` |
| Resume-after-sleep failed in firmware init | No | BLE is not up yet; client picks it up via Read on the next connect |
| Periodic BMS / GPS refresh (no charging change) | No | — |

#### Read is authoritative

NimBLE silently drops notifications to peers that have not yet enabled
the CCCD, and notifications can be lost in transit. Treat Status NOTIFY
as best-effort. Clients that just connected MUST issue a Read on Status
before relying on subsequent notifies to learn the current state.

#### Tracking started via BLE produces two notifications

When the client issues `{"op":"cmd","cmd":"start_tracking"}` (or
`"stop_tracking"`), it will receive **two** notifications on different
characteristics for the same logical event:

1. **Status NOTIFY** (this characteristic) — broadcasts the state change
   (`tracking`, `session`).
2. **Config NOTIFY** (`type: "cmd_result"`) — the response to the issued
   command, carrying `ok` and optionally `err`.

The two are distinct protocol events on distinct characteristics, not
redundant transport. Handle them in their own listeners.

#### Reconciling unexpected `tracking: true -> false`

If you receive a NOTIFY with `tracking: false` that did **not** follow
a client-issued `stop_tracking` command, treat it as "session ended on
device" and refresh local state from the device (re-list History,
re-read Status). Do not try to infer the cause from the payload — the
on-device snackbar carries the human-readable reason. The most common
causes are a manual stop on the device's own menu and (rarely) a NAND
fault at the storage layer.

### Payload

The **Read** value is a CBOR map with **all 9 keys always present**. A **NOTIFY**
payload carries only one of the two delta shapes (tracking transition or
charging transition); every other key is available via Read.

| Key | Type | In NOTIFY? | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"gps_fix"` | uint | No (Read-only) | GPS fix type: `0` = none, `2` = 2D, `3` = 3D |
| `"gps_sat"` | uint | No (Read-only) | Satellite count (0 if unavailable) |
| `"bat_pct"` | uint | Yes (charging delta) | Battery percentage, 0–100 |
| `"bat_v"` | float32 | Yes (charging delta) | Battery voltage in Volts |
| `"charging"` | text | Yes (charging delta) | Charging state (see table below) |
| `"tracking"` | bool | Yes (tracking delta) | `true` if a tracking session is active |
| `"session"` | uint | Yes (tracking delta) | Current tracking session ID (0 if not tracking) |
| `"flash_kb"` | uint | No (Read-only) | Total flash storage capacity in KB |
| `"used_kb"` | uint | No (Read-only) | Used flash storage in KB |

The firmware version is **not** in this payload. Read it from the Device
Information Service Firmware Revision characteristic (`0x2A26`, see §9).

#### Polling the non-urgent fields

The four Read-only fields above (`gps_fix`, `gps_sat`, `flash_kb`, `used_kb`)
are **never pushed** via NOTIFY. They change slowly and are not urgent, so the
device leaves them to the client to poll. While a screen that displays any of
them is visible, **poll the Status characteristic with a Read** at a sensible
cadence — roughly every **30 seconds**, aligned with the device's internal
~30 s battery-refresh rate. Polling faster yields no fresher data; stop polling
when no such screen is visible to save power. Battery and charging state arrive
promptly via the charging-transition NOTIFY, so they do not require polling.

### Charging State Values

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"none"` | Not charging |
| `"trickle"` | Trickle charge |
| `"pre"` | Pre-charge |
| `"fast"` | Fast charge |
| `"taper"` | Taper charge |
| `"topoff"` | Top-off timer active |
| `"done"` | Charge complete |
| `"unknown"` | Unknown state |

### Example

```json
{
  "gps_fix": 3,
  "gps_sat": 12,
  "bat_pct": 72,
  "bat_v": 3.85,
  "charging": "none",
  "tracking": true,
  "session": 10042,
  "flash_kb": 262144,
  "used_kb": 8192
}
```

## 7. Config Characteristic

**UUID**: `d1c0c0a3-6b48-4b2a-9b1d-59f9f2b0a1e1`
**Properties**: Read, Write, Notify
**Direction**: Bidirectional

This characteristic supports three operations:

1. **Read** — Get current device configuration.
2. **Write** — Set config values or execute commands.
3. **Notify** — Receive config change confirmations and command results.

### 7.1 Read: Get Current Config

Read the characteristic to receive the full device configuration.

#### Payload (12-key CBOR map)

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `"meas_int"` | uint | Measurement interval in seconds (1–3600). All sensors measured together at this cadence. |
| `"temp_f"` | bool | `true` = Fahrenheit, `false` = Celsius |
| `"pm_aqi"` | bool | `true` = US AQI for PM, `false` = raw ug/m3 |
| `"gps_int"` | uint | GPS update interval (seconds) |
| `"gps_mode"` | text | GPS mode (see table below) |
| `"inact_to"` | uint | Inactivity timeout (seconds) |
| `"auto_lock"` | uint | Auto-lock timeout (seconds) |
| `"dev_name"` | text | User-defined device name |
| `"op_mode"` | text | Operating mode (see table below) |
| `"fled"` | uint | Front (display) LED brightness: 0=Off, 1=Dim, 2=Mid, 3=Bright |
| `"bled"` | uint | Back (AQI) LED brightness: 0=Off, 1=Dim, 2=Mid, 3=Bright |
| `"tled"` | uint | Touch LED intensity: 0=Off, 1=Dim, 2=Bright |

#### GPS Mode Values

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"off"` | GPS always off |
| `"tracking"` | GPS on only during tracking |
| `"always"` | GPS always on |

#### Operating Mode Values

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `"portable"` | Portable mode (BLE active, battery powered) |
| `"stationary"` | Stationary mode (Wi-Fi connected, wall powered) |
| `"offline"` | Offline mode (no connectivity) |

#### Example

```json
{
  "meas_int": 10,
  "temp_f": false,
  "pm_aqi": false,
  "gps_int": 5,
  "gps_mode": "tracking",
  "inact_to": 300,
  "auto_lock": 60,
  "dev_name": "My AGo",
  "op_mode": "portable",
  "fled": 3,
  "bled": 3,
  "tled": 2
}
```

### 7.2 Write: Set Config

Write a CBOR map to update device configuration. Include `"op": "set"` and
**exactly one** config key to change. Omitted keys retain their current values.

#### Format

```json
{"op": "set", "meas_int": 30}
```

All config keys from the Read payload are supported. The `"op"` key is
required.

**Single field per write.** A `set` may carry **only one** recognized config
key. This keeps the resulting Config NOTIFY (a delta — see 7.4) within a single
ATT PDU regardless of how many config fields exist. A write carrying more than
one recognized config key (or the same key twice) is rejected before any value
is applied. To change several settings, send one `set` per field.

Deprecated keys (`"pm_int"`, `"other_int"`, `"disp_int"`) are accepted and
silently ignored for backward compatibility. They do not modify any setting.

#### Config key types for writes

| Key | Expected Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `"meas_int"` | uint | 1–3600 seconds |
| `"temp_f"` | bool | |
| `"pm_aqi"` | bool | |
| `"gps_int"` | uint | |
| `"gps_mode"` | text | `"off"`, `"tracking"`, or `"always"` |
| `"inact_to"` | uint | |
| `"auto_lock"` | uint | |
| `"dev_name"` | text | Max 64 characters |
| `"op_mode"` | text | `"portable"`, `"stationary"`, or `"offline"` |
| `"fled"` | uint | 0–3 (front LED brightness) |
| `"bled"` | uint | 0–3 (back LED brightness) |
| `"tled"` | uint | 0–2 (touch LED intensity) |

#### Response

After applying the config change, the device sends a **Config notification**
(see 7.4 below). No progress notification is sent for config set operations.

The write is rejected before any value is applied if it contains an
**unrecognized config key** (`unknown_config_key`, checked first) or **more than
one recognized config key** (`single_field_only`). On rejection no settings are
modified and the device sends an error notification instead:

```json
{"type": "cmd_result", "cmd": "set", "ok": false, "err": "unknown_config_key"}
```

```json
{"type": "cmd_result", "cmd": "set", "ok": false, "err": "single_field_only"}
```

Aiding keys (`lat`, `lon`, `alt`, `pos_acc`, `epoch`, `time_acc`) are valid only
under `op:"cmd"` (`set_aiding`); under `op:"set"` they are rejected as
`unknown_config_key`.

### 7.3 Write: Execute Command

Write a CBOR map to execute a device command.

#### Format

```json
{"op": "cmd", "cmd": "co2_cal"}
```

#### Supported Commands

| `"cmd"` Value | Action |
|---|---|
| `"co2_cal"` | Trigger CO2 sensor background calibration |
| `"clear_data"` | Erase all stored route data and clear chart cache |
| `"factory_rst"` | Reset to factory defaults: clears data, restores default settings, deletes BLE bonds, and reboots the device |
| `"start_tracking"` | Begin GPS + sensor route logging session |
| `"stop_tracking"` | End the current route logging session |
| `"set_aiding"` | Inject A-GNSS aiding data (position and/or time) to speed up GPS fix |

#### Response

Long-running commands (`"co2_cal"`, `"clear_data"`, `"factory_rst"`) send
a **command progress notification** (see 7.5 below) immediately when the
command is accepted, followed by a **command result notification** (see 7.6
below) when the operation completes or fails.

Other commands (`"start_tracking"`, `"stop_tracking"`, `"set_aiding"`) respond
with a command result notification only (no progress notification).

**Notes**:

- After `"factory_rst"`, the device reboots. The BLE connection will
  drop, and all bond information is erased. The phone will need to re-pair on
  the next connection.
- `"start_tracking"` fails with `"err": "already_tracking"` if a tracking
  session is already active, or with `"err": "flash_error"` if the storage
  layer cannot open the route file (NAND unmounted, session-id space
  exhausted, or fsync failure on the empty file). The device additionally
  surfaces this on-screen via a `"Storage error — can't track"` snackbar.
- `"stop_tracking"` fails with `"err": "not_tracking"` if no tracking
  session is active.
- After a successful `"start_tracking"` or `"stop_tracking"`, the device
  also pushes a **Status NOTIFY** with the new `"tracking"` / `"session"`
  values. Clients subscribed to Status will therefore see two
  notifications per tracking transition: one Config `cmd_result` and one
  Status NOTIFY (see §6).
- `"set_aiding"` accepts optional position and/or time fields (see below).
  At least one useful piece of data must be present; otherwise the command
  fails with `"err": "no_aiding_data"`.

#### Set Aiding Payload

The `"set_aiding"` command carries optional aiding data fields in the same
CBOR map. The device forwards valid data to the GPS module to reduce
cold-start time-to-first-fix (TTFF).

```json
{
  "op": "cmd",
  "cmd": "set_aiding",
  "lat": 47.376887,
  "lon": 8.541694,
  "alt": 408.0,
  "pos_acc": 50.0,
  "epoch": 1711234567,
  "time_acc": 2000
}
```

| Key | Type | Unit | Description | Required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `"lat"` | float64 | decimal degrees | Approximate latitude | No |
| `"lon"` | float64 | decimal degrees | Approximate longitude | No |
| `"alt"` | float32 | meters MSL | Approximate altitude | No |
| `"pos_acc"` | float32 | meters (1-sigma) | Position accuracy estimate | No |
| `"epoch"` | uint | POSIX seconds | Current UTC time | No |
| `"time_acc"` | uint | milliseconds | Time accuracy estimate | No |

**Position injection** requires both `"lat"` and `"lon"` to be present and
valid. `"alt"` and `"pos_acc"` are optional refinements.

**Time injection** requires `"epoch"` to be non-zero.

The phone should send this command shortly after connecting, using the
phone's own location and clock as the data source. It can also be re-sent
whenever the phone obtains a significantly updated position.

**System clock side-effect**: If the device's system clock has not yet been
synced (no GPS timestamp received), and the aiding data includes a valid
`"epoch"`, the device also sets its internal clock from the aiding epoch.
This provides meaningful timestamps for route-point data before the first
GPS fix arrives. The aiding epoch is approximate, so the device does not
mark the clock as synced — when a real GPS timestamp arrives, it overwrites
with the authoritative time.

### 7.4 Notify: Config Changed

Subscribe to Config notifications to receive confirmation when any
configuration change is applied (whether from this BLE client, another
source, or the device's own UI).

#### Payload (delta CBOR map)

A Config NOTIFY is a **delta**, not the full snapshot: `"type": "config"` plus
**only the field(s) that changed**. A single-field `set` (and the device UI,
which normally changes one setting at a time) yields a 2-key map:

```json
{"type": "config", "meas_int": 10}
```

Merge the changed key(s) into your local model. A change that touches nothing
yields `{"type": "config"}` alone (treat as a no-op). The full config is always
available via **Read / Read-Long** (no `"type"` key) — re-read it on connect to
establish the baseline. The `"type"` key distinguishes this from command
notifications (all arrive on the same characteristic; Read always returns the
config snapshot regardless of which notification kind was last sent).

If a notification **fails to CBOR-decode**, do not guess — re-Read the
characteristic. A notification is a single ATT PDU and is never fragmented, so a
payload that exceeds the negotiated MTU is truncated by the stack; a failed
decode is the client's signal to fall back to the authoritative Read. Keeping a
negotiated MTU ≥ 185 B (see §11) makes this path unnecessary in practice.

Decoupling NOTIFY from the Read snapshot keeps every notification within one ATT
PDU, independent of how many config fields the snapshot grows to carry.

### 7.5 Notify: Command Progress

For long-running commands (`"co2_cal"`, `"clear_data"`, `"factory_rst"`),
the device sends a progress notification immediately when the command is
accepted, before the actual work begins. This lets the client show a
loading indicator while waiting for the final result.

```json
{"type": "cmd_progress", "cmd": "co2_cal"}
```

2 keys: `"type"`, `"cmd"`. No `"ok"` or `"err"` keys.

The `"cmd"` value echoes the command string from the write request.

**Client handling**: When a `"cmd_progress"` notification arrives, display a
progress/loading state for the indicated command. The final outcome will
arrive as a separate `"cmd_result"` notification. Clients that do not
recognize `"cmd_progress"` can safely ignore it — the `"cmd_result"`
notification is unchanged and self-contained.

**Timing**: The progress notification arrives within milliseconds of the
write. The subsequent `"cmd_result"` may arrive immediately (e.g., sensor
does not support calibration) or after a significant delay (CO2 calibration
can take up to 60 seconds).

### 7.6 Notify: Command Result

After executing a command, the device sends a result notification.

#### Success

```json
{"type": "cmd_result", "cmd": "co2_cal", "ok": true}
```

3 keys: `"type"`, `"cmd"`, `"ok"`.

#### Failure

```json
{"type": "cmd_result", "cmd": "co2_cal", "ok": false, "err": "calibration_failed"}
```

4 keys: `"type"`, `"cmd"`, `"ok"`, `"err"`.

The `"err"` key is only present when `"ok"` is `false` and an error
description is available.

#### Command Error Strings

| Error String | Command | Cause |
|---|---|---|
| `"unsupported"` | `co2_cal` | CO2 sensor does not support calibration |
| `"calibration_failed"` | `co2_cal` | CO2 calibration procedure failed |
| `"clear_failed"` | `clear_data` | Route data erase did not complete fully |
| `"factory_reset_failed"` | `factory_rst` | Settings save, data clear, or bond delete failed |
| `"already_tracking"` | `start_tracking` | Tracking session was already active |
| `"flash_error"` | `start_tracking` | Storage layer could not open the route file: NAND unmounted, session-id collision exhaustion, or fsync failure. Device shows `"Storage error — can't track"` on-screen. |
| `"not_tracking"` | `stop_tracking` | No tracking session was active |
| `"no_aiding_data"` | `set_aiding` | No valid position or time data in the payload |
| `"unknown_command"` | (any) | Unrecognised `"cmd"` string |
| `"unknown_config_key"` | `set` | Config write contained an unrecognised key (or an aiding key under `op:"set"`); entire write rejected |
| `"single_field_only"` | `set` | Config write carried more than one recognized config key (or a duplicate); entire write rejected |

### 7.7 Notification Dispatch

Config notifications always contain a `"type"` key. Use it to dispatch:

| `"type"` Value | Notification Kind |
|---|---|
| `"config"` | Config changed — delta (changed key(s) only); merge into local model |
| `"cmd_progress"` | Command accepted — show loading state |
| `"cmd_result"` | Command finished — check `"ok"` and `"err"` |

## 8. History Characteristic

**UUID**: `d1c0c0a4-6b48-4b2a-9b1d-59f9f2b0a1e1`
**Properties**: Write, Notify
**Direction**: Bidirectional

Bulk export of stored route session data from the device's flash storage.
This is a stateful download protocol using CBOR for control messages and
packed binary for bulk data transfer.

### 8.1 Notification Format

Every History notification starts with a **1-byte type tag**:

| Tag | Content | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `0x00` | CBOR map | Control response (session list, started, done, ended, error) |
| `0x01` | Binary data | Route point data chunk |

**Important**: Strip the first byte before decoding. CBOR payloads start at
byte index 1.

### 8.2 Write Commands (Phone -> Device)

All writes are CBOR maps with an `"op"` key.

#### List Sessions

```json
{"op": "list"}
```

Request the list of stored route sessions. Can be sent at any time.

#### Start Download

```json
{"op": "start", "session": 10042}
```

Start downloading all points for the specified session. The `"session"` value
is a session ID obtained from the session list.

#### Fill Missing Points

```json
{"op": "fill", "pts": [12, 13, 14, 15, 78]}
```

Request retransmission of specific point indices that were missed during the
initial download. The `"pts"` array contains zero-based point indices. Can
only be sent after a download has completed (after receiving `"done"`).

The device's write buffer (256 bytes) limits the `"pts"` array to
approximately 50 indices per request. For larger gaps, send multiple `fill`
requests.

#### End Download

```json
{"op": "end"}
```

Signal that the download is complete. Cleans up server-side state.

#### Delete Session

```json
{"op": "delete", "session": 10042}
```

Delete a single route session from the device's flash storage. The
`"session"` value is a session ID obtained from the session list.

The device rejects deletion of the currently active tracking session
(returns `"session_active"` error). If the session is currently being
downloaded, the device silently ends the export before deleting.

After a successful delete, the device updates its Status characteristic
internally so the next read reflects the reduced `"used_kb"`.

Can be sent at any time (does not require an active download).

### 8.3 Notify Responses (Device -> Phone)

All CBOR responses are prefixed with tag byte `0x00`. Decode the CBOR
starting at byte index 1.

#### Session List

Sent in response to `{"op": "list"}`. The response is **paginated** — the
device sends one notification per page. Each notification is self-contained
with pagination metadata. Collect pages until `"pg" == "tpg"`.

```json
{
  "type": "sessions",
  "sessions": [
    {"id": 10001, "pts": 150, "ts": 1737000000},
    {"id": 10002, "pts": 300, "ts": 1737100000}
  ],
  "pg": 1,
  "tpg": 3,
  "cnt": 13
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `"id"` | uint | Session ID |
| `"pts"` | uint | Number of route points in this session |
| `"ts"` | uint | Session start time (unix seconds) |
| `"pg"` | uint | Current page number (1-based) |
| `"tpg"` | uint | Total number of pages |
| `"cnt"` | uint | Total number of sessions across all pages |

Sessions are paginated in groups of 6 per notification. There is no hard
cap on the total number of sessions — all sessions stored on the device
are included. If the device has no sessions, a single page is sent with
an empty `"sessions"` array and `"cnt": 0`.

#### Download Started

Sent at the beginning of a `start` operation, before binary data streaming
begins.

```json
{"type": "started", "session": 10042, "total": 300, "pt_size": 56}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `"session"` | uint | Session ID being downloaded |
| `"total"` | uint | Total number of points in this session |
| `"pt_size"` | uint | Bytes per route point (always 56) |

The `"pt_size"` field allows the client to verify wire format compatibility.
If `"pt_size"` is not 56, the client should abort — the binary format is
incompatible.

#### Binary Data Chunks

Sent after `"started"`. Tagged with `0x01`.

Binary layout:

```text
[0x01] [uint16_le point_index] [RoutePointWire...]
```

| Offset | Size | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 1 | uint8 | Tag: `0x01` |
| 1 | 2 | uint16_le | Index of the first point in this chunk |
| 3 | N*56 | bytes | Packed RoutePointWire data |

Each notification contains up to **4 route points** (4 x 56 = 224 bytes of
point data, plus 3 bytes header = 227 bytes total).

Points are streamed sequentially starting from index 0. The `point_index`
field tells the client which points are in this notification. Use it to
detect gaps (missed notifications).

#### Download Done

Sent after all binary data has been streamed (for both `start` and `fill`
operations).

```json
{"type": "done", "sent": 300}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `"sent"` | uint | Number of points actually sent |

#### Download Ended

Sent in response to `{"op": "end"}`.

```json
{"type": "ended"}
```

#### Session Deleted

Sent in response to a successful `{"op": "delete"}`.

```json
{"type": "deleted", "session": 10042}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `"session"` | uint | Session ID that was deleted |

#### Error

Sent when an operation fails.

```json
{"type": "error", "err": "session_not_found"}
```

| Error String | Cause |
|---|---|
| `"session_not_found"` | The requested session ID does not exist |
| `"no_active_download"` | `fill` was sent without a prior `start` |
| `"flash_error"` | Flash storage read failed during streaming |
| `"delete_failed"` | Flash storage delete failed |
| `"session_active"` | Cannot delete the active tracking session |
| `"busy"` | Provisioning Wi-Fi radio is active; export refused (see §10) |

```

#### With Gap Recovery

BLE notifications are unreliable — they can be lost. The client should track
which point indices it received and use `fill` to request any gaps.

```text

  |                                  |

  |---- {"op": "end"} ------------>|
  |<-- [0x00] ended ----------------|
```

#### Delete a Session

```text
Phone                              Device
  |                                  |
  |---- {"op": "list"} ------------>|
  |<-- [0x00] sessions list --------|
  |                                  |
  |  (user selects session to delete)|
  |                                  |
  |---- {"op": "delete", session: N}|
  |<-- [0x00] deleted (session: N) -|
  |                                  |
  |  (optionally re-list to confirm) |
  |                                  |
  |---- {"op": "list"} ------------>|
  |<-- [0x00] sessions list --------|
```

If the session is currently being tracked:

```text
Phone                              Device
  |                                  |
  |---- {"op": "delete", session: N}|
  |<-- [0x00] error: session_active |
```

### 8.5 Client Implementation Guide

1. **Subscribe** to History notifications before sending any write commands.
2. **List sessions** with `{"op": "list"}` to discover available data.
3. **Start download** with `{"op": "start", "session": <id>}`.
4. **Buffer incoming notifications** — dispatch by first byte tag:
   - `0x00`: Decode CBOR, handle control message.
   - `0x01`: Extract `point_index` (bytes 1-2, little-endian uint16), then
     parse route point data starting at byte 3.
5. **Track received indices** to detect gaps after `"done"` is received.
6. **Fill gaps** if any point indices are missing, using one or more `fill`
   commands.
7. **End download** with `{"op": "end"}` when all data is received.
8. **Delete sessions** with `{"op": "delete", "session": <id>}` to remove
   individual route files from the device. Check the Status characteristic's
   `"tracking"` and `"session"` fields first to avoid attempting to delete
   the active tracking session.

**Gap detection**: Compare the expected set of indices `[0, total-1]` with
the indices actually received. Each binary notification's `point_index` tells
you the starting index. With 4 points per notification, a notification with
`point_index = 8` contains points 8, 9, 10, 11.

## 9. Device Information Service

Standard BLE Device Information Service (`0x180A`) exposing read-only device
identity. All characteristics are encrypted (require the bonded connection).

| Characteristic | UUID | Type | Value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model Number | `0x2A24` | UTF-8 | `"P-1PSG"` |
| Serial Number | `0x2A25` | UTF-8 | 12-char lowercase hex device serial |
| Firmware Revision | `0x2A26` | UTF-8 | Firmware version string |
| Manufacturer Name | `0x2A29` | UTF-8 | `"AirGradient"` |

Read these once after connecting to identify the device. The same service is
also present during standalone Stationary provisioning.

The **Firmware Revision** characteristic (`0x2A26`) is the canonical source for
the running firmware version; it is not duplicated in the Status characteristic
(§6).

---

## 10. Wi-Fi Provisioning (Portable)

Configure the device's Wi-Fi credentials over the **already-bonded Portable
link** — no operating-mode switch and no re-pair. The device runs the standard
AirGradient provisioning protocol (Wi-Fi scan, credential submit, live status)
on a dedicated GATT service that sits alongside the data service.

> The same provisioning service is also used standalone in Stationary mode
> (over a Just Works connection); this section documents the Portable
> bonded-link flow.

Unlike the rest of this spec, provisioning payloads are **JSON** (UTF-8), not
CBOR.

### Service and Characteristics

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Service UUID | `acbcfea8-e541-4c40-9bfd-17820f16c95c` |

| Characteristic | UUID | Properties | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wi-Fi Scan | `467a080f-e50f-42c9-b9b2-a2ab14d82725` | Write, Notify | Bidirectional |
| Credentials/Status | `703fa252-3d2a-4da9-a05c-83b0d9cacb8e` | Read, Write, Notify | Bidirectional |

Both characteristics are encrypted; on the Portable link the existing passkey
bond satisfies that, so no extra pairing step is needed.

### Availability and the on-demand radio

- The provisioning service is present on **every Portable boot** and stays idle
  until the client writes a scan or credentials request.
- The Wi-Fi radio is **off by default** and powered only for the few seconds of
  an active scan or connect, then dropped. Two consequences for the client:
  - A scan can take several seconds (the radio time-shares the antenna with
    BLE).
  - The radio auto-drops after ~90 s of provisioning inactivity. Treat a stale
    scan list as expired and re-scan before submitting if the user lingered.

### 10.1 Wi-Fi Scan

Write **any** non-empty value to the Wi-Fi Scan characteristic to trigger a
scan. Results arrive as one or more **paginated** notifications on the same
characteristic (3 networks per page).

Page payload:

```json
{
  "wifi": [
    {"s": "HomeWiFi", "r": -45, "o": 0},
    {"s": "Cafe", "r": -67, "o": 1}
  ],
  "page": 1,
  "tpage": 2,
  "found": 5
}
```

| Key | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `"wifi"` | array | Up to 3 networks for this page |
| `"s"` | text | SSID |
| `"r"` | int | RSSI (dBm) |
| `"o"` | uint | `1` = open network, `0` = secured |
| `"page"` | uint | Current page (1-based) |
| `"tpage"` | uint | Total pages |
| `"found"` | uint | Total networks found across all pages |

Empty result (no networks): a single notification `{"found": 0}`.

Collect pages until `"page" == "tpage"`. Results are deduplicated and
RSSI-sorted by the device.

### 10.2 Submit Credentials

Write a JSON object to the Credentials/Status characteristic:

```json
{
  "ssid": "HomeWiFi",
  "password": "mypassword",
  "disableCloud": false,
  "staticIp": {
    "ip": "192.168.1.50",
    "netmask": "255.255.255.0",
    "gateway": "192.168.1.1",
    "dns": "192.168.1.1"
  }
}
```

| Key | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"ssid"` | text | Yes | Target network SSID |
| `"password"` | text | No | 8–63 chars; omit or empty for an open network |
| `"disableCloud"` | bool | No | Persisted; suppresses cloud upload in Stationary |
| `"staticIp"` | object | No | All four sub-fields required together; omit for DHCP |

`"staticIp"` sub-fields (`"ip"`, `"netmask"`, `"gateway"`, `"dns"`) are dotted
IPv4 strings. If `"staticIp"` is present it must be complete and valid,
otherwise it is ignored and the device uses DHCP.

### 10.3 Status Notifications

After credentials are submitted, the device powers the radio, attempts a single
STA connection, and notifies status on the Credentials/Status characteristic:

```json
{"status": 0}
```

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | `WIFI_CONNECTED` — connected and credentials saved |
| `10` | `WIFI_CONNECT_FAILED` — could not connect; re-prompt and retry |

> In Portable, only codes `0` and `10` are emitted. The server-reachability
> codes (`1`, `2`, `3`, `11`, `12`, `13`) defined for the provisioning service
> are produced only during Stationary onboarding, where the device performs a
> cloud check; Portable provisioning does not.

### Verify-then-drop semantics (important)

`WIFI_CONNECTED` means the credentials were **verified and saved** — it does
**not** mean the device is online to the cloud. After a successful connect the
device drops the Wi-Fi radio and **stays in Portable**. The saved credentials
are used the next time the device enters Stationary mode. The session stays
open, so the client can scan / submit again to reconfigure.

A failed connect leaves the device listening; submit corrected credentials to
retry.

### History export contention

While the provisioning radio is active (during a scan/connect), History export
requests (`list` / `start` / `fill`) are rejected with
`{"type": "error", "err": "busy"}`. Do not interleave a History download with
provisioning; retry the export once provisioning is idle.

### Flow

```text
Phone                              Device (Portable, bonded)
  |                                  |
  |-- write Scan char -------------->|  (powers Wi-Fi, scans)
  |<-- notify scan page 1/2 ---------|
  |<-- notify scan page 2/2 ---------|
  |                                  |
  |-- write Credentials char ------->|  (single STA connect)
  |<-- notify {"status": 0} ---------|  (saved + verified, radio dropped)
  |                                  |
  |  (creds used on next Stationary entry; device stays Portable)
```

### Upgrade note: GATT cache

The provisioning and DIS services are new in this firmware. A phone that bonded
to the device **before** this firmware may have a cached GATT layout without
them. If the services are missing after upgrade, refresh the GATT cache (the
device sends a Service Changed indication, `0x1801`) or remove and re-pair the
device.

---

## 11. MTU Considerations

- The client **must negotiate an ATT MTU ≥ 185 bytes** before subscribing to or
  relying on Config/Status notifications. A notification is a single ATT PDU
  capped at `MTU − 3` and cannot be fragmented; the device sizes every Config
  and Status notification to fit within the 185-byte minimum MTU (a ~182-byte
  PDU). A central left at the 23-byte ATT default will not receive these
  notifications. The device does **not** enforce or track the negotiated MTU —
  this is a client responsibility. If a notification exceeds the negotiated MTU
  it is truncated (not fragmented), surfacing as a CBOR decode failure on the
  client; treat that as a prompt to re-Read the characteristic (see §7.4).
- Modern phones (iOS 7+, Android 5+) negotiate at least a 185-byte MTU.
- Config/Status notifications are deltas (changed fields only), so they stay
  within one PDU regardless of how large the full Read snapshot grows. The full
  Config snapshot is served by Read / Read-Long (up to the 512-byte ATT ceiling)
  across multiple PDUs.
- Binary history data chunks are 227 bytes maximum (3-byte header + 4 x 56
  bytes).
- Request an MTU of at least **251 bytes** during connection for optimal
  throughput on history downloads.

---

## 12. Error Reference

### Config Command Errors

Command result notifications (`"type": "cmd_result"`) may include an `"err"`
field. Error strings are operation-specific and defined by the device
firmware.

### History Protocol Errors

| Error | Meaning | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `"session_not_found"` | Session ID doesn't exist | Re-list sessions |
| `"no_active_download"` | `fill` sent without `start` | Send `start` first |
| `"flash_error"` | Storage read failed | Retry or skip session |
| `"delete_failed"` | Flash delete failed | Retry or ignore |
| `"session_active"` | Cannot delete the active tracking session | Stop tracking first via Config `"stop_tracking"` command, then retry |
| `"busy"` | Provisioning Wi-Fi radio is active | Wait until provisioning is idle (radio drops after a scan/connect or ~90 s), then retry |

### Connection Errors

- If the device disconnects during a history download, the download state is
  automatically cleaned up on the device side. The client must restart the
  download from `start` after reconnecting.
- The device is a single-connection peripheral. Only one phone can connect
  at a time.

---

## Appendix: RoutePointWire Binary Format

Each route point is 56 bytes, packed little-endian. Use this layout to parse
binary data from History notifications.

| Offset | Size | Type | Field | Invalid Sentinel |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 4 | uint32_le | timestamp (unix seconds) | — |
| 4 | 8 | float64_le | latitude (degrees) | `91.0` |
| 12 | 8 | float64_le | longitude (degrees) | `181.0` |
| 20 | 4 | float32_le | altitude (meters MSL) | `-10000.0` |
| 24 | 1 | uint8 | gps_fix (0=none, 2=2D, 3=3D) | — |
| 25 | 4 | float32_le | temperature (Celsius) | `-1001.0` |
| 29 | 4 | float32_le | humidity (%) | `-1.0` |
| 33 | 4 | float32_le | pm1.0 (ug/m3) | `-1.0` |
| 37 | 4 | float32_le | pm2.5 (ug/m3) | `-1.0` |
| 41 | 4 | float32_le | pm10 (ug/m3) | `-1.0` |
| 45 | 2 | int16_le | co2 (ppm) | `-1` |
| 47 | 2 | int16_le | tvoc_index | `-1` |
| 49 | 2 | int16_le | nox_index | `-1` |
| 51 | 4 | float32_le | pressure (hPa) | `-1001.0` |
| 55 | 1 | uint8 | battery_percentage (0–100 %) | `255` |

**Total**: 56 bytes per point.

### Parsing Notes

- All multi-byte fields are **little-endian**.
- Check each field against its sentinel value to determine validity. If a
  field equals its sentinel, treat it as "not available."
- The `timestamp` field is always valid (no sentinel).
- The `gps_fix` field is always valid (0 means no fix).

## Appendix: CBOR Quick Reference

CBOR (RFC 8949) is a binary serialization format. Most platforms have CBOR
libraries available:

| Platform | Library |
|---|---|
| iOS/Swift | `SwiftCBOR`, `CBORCoding` |
| Android/Kotlin | `cbor-java`, `jackson-dataformat-cbor` |

### Decoding Example (Pseudocode)

```text
// Measures notification (no tag prefix)
raw_bytes = notification.value
map = cbor_decode(raw_bytes)
if "t" in map:
    temperature = map["t"]   // float32
if "co2" in map:
    co2 = map["co2"]         // uint

// History notification (has tag prefix)
raw_bytes = notification.value
tag = raw_bytes[0]
if tag == 0x00:
    map = cbor_decode(raw_bytes[1:])
    handle_control(map)
elif tag == 0x01:
    point_index = uint16_le(raw_bytes[1:3])
    point_data = raw_bytes[3:]
    parse_route_points(point_index, point_data)
```

## Appendix: Invalid Sentinel Values

These sentinel values indicate "data not available" in the binary route point
format. In CBOR payloads, unavailable fields are simply omitted (key absent).

| Field | Sentinel Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| latitude | `91.0` | Outside valid range [-90, 90] |
| longitude | `181.0` | Outside valid range [-180, 180] |
| altitude | `-10000.0` | Below minimum plausible altitude |
| temperature | `-1001.0` | Below absolute zero in any unit |
| humidity | `-1.0` | Below valid range [0, 100] |
| pm1.0 / pm2.5 / pm10 | `-1.0` | Negative PM is impossible |
| co2 | `-1` (int16) | Negative CO2 is impossible |
| tvoc_index | `-1` (int16) | Negative index is impossible |
| nox_index | `-1` (int16) | Negative index is impossible |
| pressure | `-1001.0` | Below valid atmospheric range |
| battery_percentage | `255` (uint8) | Outside valid range [0, 100] |
