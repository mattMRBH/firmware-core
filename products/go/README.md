# AirGradient Go

Firmware for the [AirGradient Go](https://www.airgradient.com/portable/)
portable air quality monitor with GPS, e-paper display, BLE, and battery.

## Sensors

- **PM** — Sensirion SPS30 (PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10 mass + particle counts)
- **CO2** — SenseAir S12 / Sensirion SCD4x / Sensirion STCC4 (probed in
  order at boot; first detected wins)
- **TVOC / NOx** — Sensirion SGP41
- **Temp / Humidity** — SHT40 on V1, then fallback from CO2 and pressure
  sensors
- **Pressure** — Infineon DPS368
- **Battery** — TI BQ25629 charger IC; TI BQ27427 Impedance Track fuel gauge
  (V1 board only)

## Hardware Notes

A single firmware binary supports both the **Prototype** and **V1** boards.
Board variant is detected at runtime by probing the BQ27427 fuel gauge at
I2C address `0x55` during `init_buses()`. All variant-conditional behavior is
gated on `board.variant()`.

| Variant | PM Enable Polarity | Fuel Gauge | SOC Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prototype | Active-high (level 1) | None | BQ25629 voltage-curve estimate |
| V1 | Active-low (level 0) | BQ27427 | FG-derived (BQ25629 fallback) |

### Temperature and Humidity Source

V1 boards probe SHT40 during `sensors()`. `SensorManager` resolves
`temp_hum_a` in this priority order: dedicated SHT40, CO2-integrated T/RH
(SCD4x or STCC4), then DPS368 temperature-only fallback. Prototype boards do
not probe SHT40 and use the same fallback chain without the dedicated source.

### PMID Power Rail

The SPS30 PM sensor is powered by the PMID +5 V rail from the BQ25629.
PMID `EN_OTG` is armed **once during BMS init** and held for the lifetime
of the session. The chip handles VBUS pass-through ↔ boost transitions
autonomously based on its own VBUS-detect:

- VBUS present → buck pass-through (`EN_OTG` masked internally by the chip)
- VBUS absent → boost runs to drive PMID = 5 V from VBAT

`set_pm_power(true/false)` drives only the EN_PM load switch GPIO that
gates PMID → SPS30 VDD. It cuts the SPS30's ~50 mA fan current between
measurements without ever touching `EN_OTG`.

Per-measurement `EN_OTG` toggling was tried (saves ~220 µA quiescent on
battery when PM is off) and reverted: each boost cold-start charges the
PMID output capacitance from ~VBAT to 5.1 V with an inrush spike that can
exceed 1S cell-protection OCP, opening the protection FET and causing a
POWERON reset. Holding `EN_OTG=1` trades ~220 µA quiescent for indefinite
uptime on battery.

All three boot paths call `init_core()` (which runs `init_bms()` →
arms PMID) before `power().set_pm_power(true)` and `sensors()`.

### Cell Safety

- **EDV (over-discharge):** ship mode requested when cell voltage stays
  below 2.9 V for 3 consecutive polls while on battery. The orchestrator
  shows a warning on `Screen::Info` before entering ship mode.
- **OT (over-temperature):** charge cutoff at 50 C (resume at 47 C);
  ship mode requested at 60 C with a warning display before shutdown.
- **Full-charge pause:** when the battery is full and USB is present,
  charging is disabled to reduce cell stress. Resumes when SOC drops
  to 95 %. V1 uses the BQ27427 FC flag; Prototype falls back to
  BQ25629 `ChargeTerminationDone` + 100 % SOC.
- **BATFET_DLY:** explicitly cleared to 0 (25 ms fast disconnect)
  during BQ25629 init for deterministic ship-mode timing.

### Fuel Gauge (V1 Only)

On V1, `init_bms()` initialises the BQ27427 with a two-pass corruption
recovery sequence and idempotent cell-config write. At runtime,
`poll_bms()` prefers FG-derived SOC and surfaces FG telemetry in
`PowerSnapshot`. Three log lines are emitted per poll: charger status,
BQ25629 ADC telemetry, and FG telemetry with decoded flags
(`FgFlags::FC`, `CHG`, `DSG`, etc.).
