# Cloud Service

Product service that owns the Stationary cloud transport for AirGradient Go:
periodic POST of the latest `MeasuresAGo` snapshot and periodic FETCH of
device configuration via `AgClient` on a dedicated low-priority task. The
orchestrator owns mode policy and event dispatch; `CloudService` owns the
HTTP cadence, snapshot lifetime, and `AgClient` interactions. Active only in
`OperatingMode::Stationary` while Wi-Fi is online.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `products/go/main/go_cloud.h` | `CloudService` class declaration, `Deps` and `Config` structs |
| `products/go/main/go_cloud.cpp` | Task body, deadline math, snapshot mutex, `AgClient` calls, event posting |
| `products/go/main/go_cloud_types.h` | Fixed cloud result and correction-update payloads shared with `go_events.h` |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Source | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `AgClient` | `airgradient-client` (`services/ag_client.h`) | `http_post_measures()`, `http_fetch_config()` |
| `WifiService` | product (`go_wifi.h`) | `rssi()` at post time |
| `Event`, `EventType` | product (`go_events.h`) | Posts `PostMeasuresResult`, `FetchConfigResult` to the orchestrator queue |
| `RTOS` | `airgradient-common` (`rtos.h`) | Task create/delete, mutex, semaphore, queue send, notify, time |
| `GoBoard::ag_client()` | product (`go_board.h`) | Lazy accessor; runs `AgClient::begin(serial, Wifi)` on first call |

## Public API

`CloudService` is constructed once by `GoApp` at boot and stays alive for
the process lifetime. All action methods are safe to call from the
orchestrator task at any time, including before `start()` or after `stop()`.

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `CloudService(queue, deps, cfg)` | Construct with event queue, borrowed `AgClient` and `WifiService`, and cadence config. No heap claimed. |
| `start()` | Allocate fetch buffer + semaphore, spawn task. Idempotent. Returns false on failure (self-cleans). |
| `stop()` | Drain in-flight HTTP, delete task, free heap. Bounded by ~15 s. Idempotent. |
| `arm(fire_now)` | Enable periodic ticks. `fire_now` makes the first cycle immediate (consumed on Disarmed→Armed transition only). |
| `disarm()` | Disable periodic ticks. In-flight HTTP still drains and posts its result event. |
| `set_disable_cloud(disable)` | Push the `disable_cloud` flag; sampled on the next iteration. |
| `update_measures_snapshot(m)` | Replace the cached `MeasuresAGo` under a mutex (~µs hold). |

See [`go_cloud.h`](../main/go_cloud.h) for full signatures.

## Config

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `post_interval_ms` | `60'000` | POST cadence (start-anchored) |
| `fetch_interval_ms` | `60'000` | FETCH cadence (start-anchored) |
| `disable_cloud` | `false` | Initial value; runtime changes via `set_disable_cloud()` |

File-local constants in `go_cloud.cpp`:

| Constant | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CLOUD_TASK_STACK_SIZE` | `8192` | Task stack from heap (only while running) |
| `CLOUD_TASK_PRIORITY` | `4` | Below SensorProducer (5), above GpsService (3) |
| `FETCH_BUFFER_BYTES` | `2048` | Heap-allocated fetch response buffer, including the terminating NUL |

## Behavior

### Heap Lifecycle

The constructor claims only the small object footprint (atomics, snapshot
member, mutex). Real heap is deferred to `start()`:

- **`start()`** — allocates 8 KB task stack + 2 KB fetch buffer +
  semaphore. Called by the orchestrator only after Wi-Fi is online.
- **`stop()`** — frees all heap; returns to boot-time footprint.
- Portable / Offline modes never call `start()`.

### Task Loop

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> CheckShutdown
    CheckShutdown --> Done: _shutdown_pending
    CheckShutdown --> HandleTransition: sample armed + disable
    HandleTransition --> Idle: not armed or disabled
    HandleTransition --> CheckPOST: armed and enabled
    CheckPOST --> DoPOST: post_due
    CheckPOST --> CheckFETCH: not due
    DoPOST --> CheckShutdown: re-sample state
    CheckFETCH --> DoFETCH: fetch_due
    CheckFETCH --> Sleep: not due
    DoFETCH --> CheckShutdown: re-sample state
    Idle --> CheckShutdown: wake or timeout
    Sleep --> CheckShutdown: wake or timeout
    Done --> [*]
```

POST is checked before FETCH on every iteration. After each HTTP call,
the loop re-samples `_armed` and `_disable_cloud` before considering the
next leg. This guarantees a `disarm()` or `set_disable_cloud(true)`
arriving during a POST gates the FETCH out.

Deadlines are start-anchored: `_post_due = post_started_at + interval`,
not completion time. A 15 s POST leaves 45 s before the next one.

### RSSI Translation

`WIFI_RSSI_INVALID` (0) is translated to `-127` before posting so the
dashboard never sees a misleading 0 dB.

### Shutdown

`stop()` sets the shutdown latch, wakes the task, and waits on the
done-semaphore. The task gives the semaphore and parks on an infinite
notify-wait (avoids a FreeRTOS double-delete race). `stop()` then
deletes the task and frees resources. Worst-case latency is one HTTP
timeout (~15 s).

## Orchestrator Wiring

| Orchestrator method | Cloud action |
|---|---|
| `enter_stationary()` | `set_disable_cloud()` + set first-post latch (no `start()`) |
| `on_wifi_connected()` | `start()` + `arm(first_post_pending)` |
| `on_wifi_disconnected()` | `disarm()` (except `requested_by_user`) |
| `on_provisioning_connected()` | `set_disable_cloud()` + `start()` + `arm(true)` (after provisioning teardown) |
| `change_mode(→ non-Stationary)` | `disarm()` + `stop()` (before `wifi.shutdown()`) |
| `apply_settings_change()` | `set_disable_cloud()` on flag change |
| `on_sensor_data()` | `update_measures_snapshot()` (unconditional, all modes) |
| Speculative WiFi OTA check (`check_timers()` tail) | `disarm()` up front; `arm(false)` on a no-op resume (still online) |
| Committed OTA (`enter_ota()` / `exit_ota()`) | `disarm()` on commit; `arm(false)` on resume when `wifi.is_online()` |

The cloud task is torn down **before** Wi-Fi so in-flight HTTP drains
while the socket is still alive.

### Correction Configuration

After a successful complete fetch, the cloud task parses the response body once
and queues a `FetchConfigEventPayload`. The parser selects only
`corrections.pm02`, `corrections.atmp`, and `corrections.rhum`; unrelated fields
are ignored. Each valid measure sets one bit in
`GoCloudConfigUpdate::update_mask`, so a malformed measure does not prevent
valid siblings from being delivered. Missing or invalid entries leave the active
setting unchanged. Custom coefficients must be finite JSON numbers and use the
exact cloud property names.

The orchestrator merges selected fields into a candidate `GoSettings`, activates
the candidate only after `save_go_settings()` commits successfully, and then
recomputes the corrected view from the latest raw snapshot. HTTP failures,
truncated bodies, malformed roots, and trailing non-whitespace data produce an
empty update mask.

### OTA Interaction

A Stationary WiFi OTA check shares the radio with cloud transport, so the
orchestrator pauses cloud around it with `disarm()` only — never `stop()` (see
[`orchestrator.md` → OTA](orchestrator.md#firmware-update-ota)):

- `disarm()` parks the cloud task (no new POST/FETCH) while the task + heap stay
  alive. Because the OTA transfer blocks the orchestrator and `enter_ota()`
  stops the sensor producer, the cloud task is never re-woken — it stays dormant
  for the whole transfer with no new HTTPS.
- The same handling covers both the **speculative hourly check** (no image) and
  a **committed download**: pause with `disarm()`, resume with `arm(false)` when
  `wifi.is_online()`. If Wi-Fi dropped mid-OTA, cloud is left disarmed and the
  device stays Stationary-but-offline.
- `stop()` is intentionally avoided: a committed download reboots on success (so
  freed heap is moot), and a `stop()` + `start()` round-trip would only churn /
  fragment the heap on the failure path. The one residual case — a cloud request
  already in-flight when `disarm()` is called — drains naturally during the OTA
  `open()` + partition-erase window and, in the worst case, degrades gracefully
  (a failed cloud POST is logged and retried).

## Events

| EventType | Payload | Producer |
|---|---|---|
| `PostMeasuresResult` | `CloudResultByte` (`AgClientResult`) | Cloud task after each POST |
| `FetchConfigResult` | `FetchConfigEventPayload` | Cloud task after each FETCH |

`PostMeasuresResult` remains result-byte-only. `FetchConfigResult` carries the
result byte plus the fixed, trivially-copyable correction update; it never holds
a pointer into the reusable fetch buffer.

## Heap Constraints (ESP32-C5)

The ESP32-C5 has ~183 KB of available heap. The TLS handshake with the
AirGradient backend's 4096-bit RSA certificate temporarily consumes most
of the largest free contiguous block. The Go product's sdkconfig is tuned
for this:

| Setting | Default | Go value | Saving |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG_MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN` | `16384` | `4096` | 12 KB per TLS connection |
| `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM` | `32` | `16` | Steady-state heap headroom |
| `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DYNAMIC_TX_BUFFER_NUM` | `32` | `16` | Steady-state heap headroom |

The 4 KB TLS input buffer is sufficient for the Go product's small
payloads (POST response < 256 bytes, FETCH config < 1 KB). The reduced
Wi-Fi buffers are adequate for the infrequent HTTP workload (two requests
per minute).

Lifecycle and HTTP paths emit `log_heap()` probes around `start()`,
`stop()`, POST, and FETCH. These probes track whether cloud task stack
allocation and TLS handshakes still leave enough contiguous heap for the
Stationary Wi-Fi / provisioning flows.

## Edge Cases / Errors

- **First POST before sensor data.** Default-constructed snapshot has
  every field at invalid sentinels; the serializer omits them and only
  the `wifi` signal byte reaches the dashboard.
- **`start()` failure.** Self-cleans on partial allocation failure. The
  orchestrator logs the error; the next `on_wifi_connected()` retries.
- **Reconnect after AP outage.** `disarm()` on disconnect, `arm(false)`
  on reconnect — cadence resumes at the next interval, no fire-immediate.
- **Mode change during in-flight HTTP.** `stop()` drains the call
  (bounded ~15 s), then Wi-Fi shuts down.
- **`set_disable_cloud(true)` while armed.** Expired deadlines are slid
  forward so re-enabling doesn't catch up on missed intervals.
- **Atomic state before `start()`.** `arm()`, `disarm()`,
  `set_disable_cloud()` all write atomics; the values persist and take
  effect when the task eventually starts.

## Testability

`CloudService` is host-testable via friend-class access
(`CloudServiceTestAccess`) and link-time stubs for `AgClient` (concrete
class, no virtuals) and `WifiService`. Tests drive the task body
deterministically via `_run_iteration(now)` with injected clock values.

Host tests live in `products/go/tests/go_cloud.tests.cpp` and cover:
transition handling, snapshot round-trip, POST/FETCH forwarding, POST
priority, start-time anchoring, overrun, disarm/disable mid-POST, RSSI
translation, shutdown latch, deadline clamp, and first-POST sentinels.

Orchestrator-level wiring is tested through the stubbed `CloudService` in
`products/go/tests/go_orchestrator.tests.cpp`.
