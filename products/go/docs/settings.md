# Settings Service

Persistent device configuration for AirGradient Go, stored in NVS via
`ConfigStore`. Follows the same pattern as the reference product
(`ReferenceSettings`): a plain struct with default member initializers and free
functions for load/save.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `products/go/main/go_settings.h` | `GoSettings` struct and load/save declarations |
| `products/go/main/go_settings.cpp` | NVS key constants, validation functions, load/save implementations |

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Source | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `ConfigStore` | `airgradient-config` (`hal/config_store.h`) | Typed key-value persistence interface |
| `NvsConfigStore` | `airgradient-config` (`backends/nvs_config_store.h`) | ESP-IDF NVS-backed implementation injected at construction |
| `OperatingMode`, `GpsMode` | product (`go_types.h`) | Enums serialized as int and reconstructed on load |
| `ConfigurationControl`, `GoConfigSource` | product (`go_config_types.h`) | Persisted remote-writer authority and shared source gate |
| `WifiStaticIpConfig` | `airgradient-wifi` (`types/wifi_types.h`) | Five-uint32 static-IP record persisted alongside the other settings |

## Public API

| Function | Returns | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `load_go_settings(store)` | `GoSettings` | Read all keys from NVS, fall back to defaults for missing or invalid values. Never fails. |
| `save_go_settings(store, settings)` | `bool` | Validate every field, then write all keys and commit. Returns `false` if validation fails or any write/commit fails. Multi-key persistence is not transactional. |

See [`go_settings.h`](../main/go_settings.h) for full signatures.

### Measurement Corrections

`GoSettings::corrections` contains the complete active correction set for PM2.5,
temperature, and humidity. Algorithms and coefficients are persisted as a
group per measure. Float coefficients use the shared `ConfigStore` four-byte
IEEE-754 blob accessors.

| Measure | Supported algorithms | Required custom values |
|---|---|---|
| PM2.5 | `none`, `epa_2021`, `custom_via_pm25_raw` | `intercept`, `scalingFactorViaPm25`, `useEpa2021` |
| Temperature | `none`, `custom` | `intercept`, `scalingFactor` |
| Humidity | `none`, `custom` | `intercept`, `scalingFactor` |

Missing or invalid algorithms fall back to `none`. A custom correction is
active only when every required coefficient is present and finite. PM2.5
`none` and `epa_2021` do not require persisted coefficients and load with
identity parameters. Factory reset writes the default all-`none` correction
set.

Wi-Fi SSID and password are owned by `WifiManager`'s saved-networks store
(its own `wifi_creds` NVS namespace, injected at construction). Only the
connection metadata (`disable_cloud`, `configuration_control`, `static_ip`)
lives in `GoSettings`.

## Load Behavior

`load_go_settings(ConfigStore &store)` reads each NVS key in sequence. For
every field:

1. Call the appropriate `store.get_*()` for the key.
2. If the read succeeds **and** the value passes field-level validation: use the
   stored value.
3. If the read fails (key absent) or validation rejects the value: keep the
   struct default.

The function never fails. It always returns a fully populated `GoSettings`
struct with either the stored or the default value for each field.
An absent or out-of-range `"cc"` key retains the `Both` default. Loading is
field-by-field and does not normalize the cross-field `Cloud` plus
`disable_cloud=true` combination; normal writers prevent that combination, and
full validation rejects it before a later save or activation.

## Save Behavior

`save_go_settings(ConfigStore &store, const GoSettings &settings)` validates
all fields up front before writing anything. If **any** field is out of range,
the function returns `false` immediately without touching NVS.

On success, all fields are written with `store.set_*()`, and `store.commit()`
is called. The function returns `true` only when all writes and the commit
succeed. It rejects `configuration_control=Cloud` with `disable_cloud=true`
before the first NVS write.

The multi-key operation has no rollback. A successful write that precedes a
later write or commit failure can remain in the store. Runtime callers avoid a
partially activated in-memory state by replacing the active candidate only
after `save_go_settings()` returns `true`.

## Validation Rules

All validation is implemented in an anonymous namespace in `go_settings.cpp`
(file-local; not visible to callers).

| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| `measure_interval_seconds` | `>= 1 && <= 3600` |
| `inactivity_timeout_seconds` | `>= 5 && <= 600` |
| `use_fahrenheit` | No range check (bool) |
| `pm_use_usaqi` | No range check (bool) |
| `gps_interval_seconds` | `>= 1 && <= 60` |
| `gps_mode` | Underlying int in `0 .. 2` (matches `GpsMode` enum values) |
| `operating_mode` | Underlying int in `0 .. 2` (matches `OperatingMode` enum values) |
| `auto_lock_seconds` | `0`, `10`, `30`, or `60` |
| `device_name` | Non-empty and `<= 64` characters |
| `disable_cloud` | No range check (bool) |
| `configuration_control` | Underlying int in `0 .. 2`; `Cloud` is invalid when `disable_cloud == true` |
| `static_ip.*` | No range check; the loader treats `static_ip.ip == 0` as DHCP and short-circuits the other four fields |
| `front_led_brightness` | Underlying int in `0 .. 3` (matches `LedBrightness` enum values) |
| `back_led_brightness` | Underlying int in `0 .. 3` (matches `LedBrightness` enum values) |
| `touch_led_intensity` | Underlying int in `0 .. 2` (matches `TouchLedIntensity` enum values) |
| `onboarding_done` | No range check (bool) |

## Stationary Networking Fields

`disable_cloud`, `configuration_control`, and `static_ip` are durable Stationary
settings. On every successful provisioning connection, the orchestrator
attempts to persist the payload's `disable_cloud` and `static_ip` values before
teardown or attached verification. A successful DHCP candidate zeros
`static_ip`, clearing previously stored static-IP fields. If persistence fails,
the previous active metadata remains in use, but Stationary provisioning
teardown or Portable attached verification continues.

When provisioning disables cloud while the active authority is `Cloud`, the
orchestrator changes authority to `Local` in the same candidate. This preserves
the invariant that a disabled cloud transport cannot be the only configuration
writer. Factory reset restores `disable_cloud=false`,
`configuration_control=Both`, and DHCP.

## Configuration Authority

`disable_cloud` and `configuration_control` are independent:

- `disable_cloud` controls outbound network work. When true, `CloudService`
  suppresses subsequent measurement POST and config FETCH attempts, Stationary
  OTA checks do not run, and the local API remains available. It does not cancel
  an in-flight cloud request. The local wire field `cloudConnection` is its
  inverse.
- `configuration_control` controls only the two remote configuration writers.
  `Local` disables cloud FETCH without affecting measurement POST. `Cloud` and
  `Both` enable FETCH.

| Active Control | Cloud Fetch | Local Server | BLE, UI, Provisioning, Factory, System |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Cloud` | Allowed | Forbidden, except an exact control-only recovery to `Local` or `Both` | Allowed |
| `Local` | Forbidden | Allowed | Allowed |
| `Both` | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed |

The local server checks authority before queueing a request, and the
orchestrator checks it again before applying the queued update. Cloud results
receive the same consumption-time check, so an in-flight FETCH result is
discarded after authority changes to `Local`. All accepted candidates still
pass full `GoSettings` validation and NVS commit before activation.

Factory reset writes default settings (`disable_cloud=false`,
`configuration_control=Both`, DHCP) and additionally calls
`WifiService::clear_credentials()` to erase all saved networks.

## First-Boot Onboarding Field

`onboarding_done` is the durable latch for the one-time Getting Started
guide. It defaults to `false`, so a fresh unbox shows the guide once after
the boot splash hands off on the first `SensorDataReady`. The orchestrator
flips it to `true` through the idempotent `mark_onboarding_done()` helper on
the first real engagement:

- a `Start using` press on `Screen::GettingStarted` (boot-gate entry),
- a successful (encrypted) BLE pairing/bond (`on_ble_auth_complete(true)`);
  a failed pair leaves the flag untouched, or
- any operating-mode change (`change_mode()`).

The helper guards redundant NVS commits — once the flag is set, further
calls are no-ops. Because the guide gate is evaluated on the `Interactive`
(`PowerOn`) boot path, which always reloads `GoSettings` from NVS, the flag
does not need an `RtcAppState` mirror. Factory reset clears it (default
`false`) so refurbished / returned units re-show the guide.

## Factory Settings

`FactorySettings` is **production-level** state, distinct from user `GoSettings`.
It holds the fuel-gauge learning run state (`fg_learning_stage`,
`fg_learning_cycle`, `fg_learning_itpor_losses`) and lives under distinct keys
(`fs_s` / `fs_c` / `fs_i`) in the **same `"go"` NVS namespace**. Because
`save_go_settings()` only rewrites the keys it enumerates, these keys are never
touched by `factory_reset()` and therefore **survive it** — a finished
(`Complete` / `Failed`) unit cannot accidentally look normal after a user reset.
Clearing the run state is an explicit `clear_factory_settings()` call, invoked
only by the learning exit gesture (a POWER press).

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `is_factory_learning_stage_active(stage)` | Boot predicate (true for every stage except `Idle`; both terminals are sticky) |
| `load_factory_settings()` / `save_factory_settings()` | Full struct round-trip |
| `save_fg_learning_state()` | Atomic single-commit run-state write (pre-ship `CycleDone`) |
| `clear_factory_settings()` | Explicit clear — **not** called by `factory_reset()` |

See [`fg_learning.md`](fg_learning.md) for the factory learning boot path.

## Relationship to RtcAppState

Some settings fields have a corresponding field in `RtcAppState` (the
RTC-memory cache used to survive deep sleep):

| Setting | `RtcAppState` field | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `operating_mode` | `mode` | Settings = durable (NVS, survives power-off). RtcAppState = fast cache (RTC memory, survives deep sleep only). |
| `gps_mode` | `gps_enabled` | `GpsMode` in settings maps to a boolean in `RtcAppState` (enabled = not AlwaysOff). |

**Startup logic:**

- **Fresh power-on:** Load from `GoSettings` (NVS), then initialize
  `RtcAppState` from those values.
- **Deep sleep timer wake:** Read `RtcAppState` directly; skip NVS to keep
  the fast path minimal.
- **Mode or GPS toggle:** Write both `GoSettings` (NVS) and `RtcAppState`.

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include "go_settings.h"

// Provided by the NVS backend (platform-specific):
NvsConfigStore store("go_cfg");

// Load — always succeeds, falls back to defaults for missing/invalid keys.
GoSettings settings = load_go_settings(store);

// Mutate a field.
settings.measure_interval_seconds = 30;

// Save — returns false if any field is invalid.
if (!save_go_settings(store, settings)) {
    ESP_LOGE(TAG, "save_go_settings: invalid settings, not written");
}
```

## Testability

`load_go_settings` and `save_go_settings` depend only on the `ConfigStore`
abstract interface. In host tests, inject a mock `ConfigStore` (e.g., via
Trompeloeil) that returns controlled values. No ESP-IDF dependency exists in
the settings logic itself.

Recommended test cases:

- Load with empty store returns all defaults.
- Load with valid stored values returns the stored values.
- Load with out-of-range stored values falls back to defaults.
- Save with valid settings returns `true` and calls `commit()`.
- Save with any single invalid field returns `false` without writing.
- Round-trip: save then load returns identical values.

## Build-Time Options

BLE link security is not part of `GoSettings`. It is always enabled: the custom
GATT service mandates pairing (Passkey Entry, bonding, MITM) and has no
build-time toggle.
