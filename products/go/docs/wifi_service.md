# Wi-Fi Service

Product service that owns the Stationary networking lifecycle for AirGradient
Go: saved-credential STA connect, factory-default fallback, interactive
provisioning (BLE / Wi-Fi captive portal), post-online disconnect state, and
credential clearing. It also coordinates the local HTTP listener and mDNS on
the HTTP server shared with provisioning. The orchestrator owns mode policy and
event routing; `WifiService` owns the mechanics, deadlines, callback adapters,
and network endpoint ordering. Active only in `OperatingMode::Stationary`.

## Public API

`WifiService` is constructed once by `GoApp` at boot, borrows four shared
network objects via the `Deps` struct, and stays alive for the lifetime of the
process. All action methods and lifecycle/deadline queries are orchestrator-task
only. The atomic online, IP, RSSI, and disconnect mirrors are safe for cross-task
reads.

| Method | Returns | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `WifiService(event_queue, deps, cfg)` | — | Construct with the central event queue, borrowed Wi-Fi/BLE/HTTP/local-server dependencies, and product config. Installs Wi-Fi callbacks initially and the provisioning event callback once for the service lifetime. |
| `has_saved_networks()` | `bool` | True when at least one network is saved. Delegates to `WifiManager`. |
| `connect_with_saved_credentials(static_ip)` | `void` | Restore Wi-Fi callbacks, arm the initial-connect deadline, and call `WifiManager::connect` with an empty SSID. One saved network connects directly with normal retry/backoff; multiple networks are scanned, ranked by RSSI, and tried with single-attempt failover. Applies `static_ip` when non-null, clears it otherwise. Resets the online latches (fresh bring-up). Posts a synthetic `WifiDisconnected` when the manager returns `NotFound`. |
| `schedule_reconnect(static_ip)` | `void` | Arm the runtime reconnect timer `reconnect_delay_ms` from now. Unlike the bring-up connect it preserves the `has_been_online()` latch and does not arm the connect window; the reconnect is issued from `tick()`. No-op when no networks are saved. Used by the orchestrator for runtime disconnects. |
| `try_default_fallback_credentials()` | `void` | Restore Wi-Fi callbacks, then single-shot STA connect to the factory-default AP (`airgradient` / `cleanair`). The explicit SSID makes the connect transient, so nothing is written to the saved-networks store. Bounded by the fallback window. |
| `start_provisioning(transport)` | `void` | Clear retained success, stop the local endpoint, cancel STA/deadlines, and start the requested provisioning transport. Defaults to `BleOnly`. |
| `switch_provisioning_transport()` | `void` | Back-to-back stop/start that flips transport, swallows the intermediate `Stopped`, and requests listener retention when one is already bound. |
| `stop_provisioning(stop_http_server = true)` | `void` | Tear down provisioning and optionally retain the listener for local-route handoff. Blocks for the component's post-connect hold after `Connected`, then reinstalls Wi-Fi callbacks. |
| `ensure_local_http()` | `bool` | Idempotently register local routes before ensuring the configured listener is active. Rolls routes back on listener failure. |
| `ensure_local_mdns()` | `bool` | Install the local `StaIpAuto` profile once and explicitly start mDNS. HTTP must already be active. |
| `stop_local_endpoint()` | `void` | Stop/clear mDNS, stop the listener, then unregister only local API routes. Idempotent. |
| `shutdown()` | `void` | Clear retained success/deadlines, stop provisioning and the local endpoint, drop STA, set Wi-Fi mode `Off`, detach callbacks, and reset online latches. |
| `clear_credentials()` | `void` | Erase all saved networks (`WifiManager::clear_networks`) and reset the online latches. Used by factory reset. |
| `is_online()` | `bool` | True after the first IP for the current attempt; cleared on disconnect. |
| `is_connecting()` | `bool` | True while the initial-connect or fallback deadline is armed and no IP has been observed. |
| `is_provisioning()` | `bool` | True while a transport is active. |
| `current_transport()` | `ProvisioningTransport` | Active transport (only meaningful while `is_provisioning()`). |
| `ip()` | `uint32_t` | Last observed IP (network byte order). 0 when not online. |
| `rssi()` | `int` | Snapshot RSSI from `WifiManager`. |
| `last_disconnect_reason()` | `WifiDisconnectReason` | Last reported disconnect reason (defaults to `unknown` on construction). |
| `has_been_online()` | `bool` | Latches true on the first IP for the current Stationary entry. Reset by `shutdown()`, `clear_credentials()`, and fresh STA connect attempts. The orchestrator gates the disconnect policy on this flag. |
| `next_deadline_ms()` | `uint32_t` | Nearer of the initial-connect / fallback window and the runtime reconnect timer, or 0 when neither is armed. Drives `Orchestrator::compute_queue_timeout_ms()`. |
| `tick(now_ms)` | `void` | Retry a retained provisioning `Connected` event, consume the pending deadline clear, expire the connect window, and issue a due runtime reconnect. |

## Construction

`GoApp` constructs `WifiService` after the shared radio objects are
available from the board, alongside `BleService`:

```cpp
WifiService::Deps deps{
    _board.wifi_manager(),
    _board.ble_server(),
    _board.http_server(),
    local_server,
};
WifiService::Config cfg{};
cfg.ap_ssid              = "airgradient-<12-hex>";   // built from serial
cfg.hostname             = "airgradient_<12-hex>";   // local mDNS hostname
cfg.ble_device_name      = "AirGradient Go <last4>"; // same name as Portable
cfg.ble_manufacturer_data = "P-1PSG#<12-hex>";       // built from serial
cfg.ble_model_name        = "P-1PSG";
// ble_serial_number, ble_firmware_version come from the board
auto *wifi = new WifiService(event_queue, deps, cfg);
```

See [`go_app.cpp`](../main/go_app.cpp) for the runtime wiring of both
interactive and button-wake boot paths.

`BleService` and `WifiService` borrow the same `AgBleServer`. The
orchestrator enforces mutual exclusion: Portable mode owns the server
through `BleService`; Stationary provisioning owns it through the
borrowed `ProvisioningManager`. Mode changes always tear down the
outgoing owner before bringing up the incoming one.

Stationary provisioning and the local API also borrow the same process-lifetime
`HttpServer` object. Their routes never overlap: provisioning owns its transport
routes during setup, then hands ownership to `LocalServer` after a successful
connection. Wi-Fi provisioning can retain an already-bound listener during the
handoff. A directly started BLE-only session has no HTTP listener; BLE-only
reached through a Wi-Fi-to-BLE transport switch can inherit the retained
listener.

`WifiService` owns the **Stationary** `ProvisioningManager` instance.
Portable mode has its own separate manager instance inside
`PortableWifiProvisioner` (the attached transport — see
[`portable_provisioner.md`](portable_provisioner.md)). The two managers
never run concurrently (Portable and Stationary never overlap); the only
cross-mode seam is persisted state (the saved-networks store plus
`static_ip` / `disable_cloud`).

## Config

`WifiService::Config` carries everything that can vary per product.
Defaults are listed where they exist; the rest come from `GoApp`.

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ap_ssid` | — (required) | Captive-portal AP SSID; `GoApp` builds `"airgradient-<MAC>"` from the device serial |
| `ap_password` | `"cleanair"` | Captive-portal AP password; also passed into `UIManager::Config::ap_password` so the Provisioning page's Wi-Fi QR (`WIFI:` descriptor) and instruction line use the same string |
| `ap_channel` | `1` | Captive-portal AP channel |
| `ble_device_name` | `"AirGradient"` | BLE advertised name during provisioning; `GoApp` overrides it to `"AirGradient Go <last4>"` (via `compute_ble_adv_name()`) so Stationary provisioning matches the Portable name |
| `ble_model_name` | — | DIS Model Number (set by `GoApp` to `"P-1PSG"`) |
| `ble_serial_number` | — | DIS Serial Number string (board MAC) |
| `ble_firmware_version` | — | DIS Firmware Revision string |
| `ble_manufacturer_data` | — | BLE manufacturer data after the company ID prefix |
| `ble_auth_flags` | `AgBleAuth::SC` | Just Works Secure Connections, no BOND, no MITM |
| `initial_connect_window_ms` | `30000` | Saved-credentials connect window |
| `fallback_ssid` | `"airgradient"` | Factory-default fallback AP |
| `fallback_password` | `"cleanair"` | Factory-default fallback AP password |
| `fallback_connect_window_ms` | `15000` | Factory-default fallback window upper bound |
| `reconnect_delay_ms` | `5000` | Delay between runtime reconnect cycles (after the first online) |
| `serial_number` / `firmware_version` / `model` | — | Local mDNS TXT identity; strings are borrowed for the service lifetime |
| `hostname` | — | Local mDNS hostname and provisioning hostname |
| `http_port` | `80` | Shared provisioning and local API listener port |

The provisioning BLE transport is configured for one-shot Wi-Fi
onboarding: `NO_INPUT_NO_OUTPUT` IO capability and `AgBleAuth::SC` only
(no BOND, no MITM). Portable BLE keeps its stronger `DISPLAY_ONLY` +
`BOND | MITM` configuration; the two transports do not share security
state, and Stationary provisioning never weakens or replaces an existing
Portable bond.

## Behavior

### Connection Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Off
    Off --> ConnectingSaved: connect_with_saved_credentials
    Off --> TryingFallback: try_default_fallback_credentials
    ConnectingSaved --> Online: on_got_ip
    ConnectingSaved --> Off: shutdown
    ConnectingSaved --> Off: deadline expires (synthetic connection_lost)
    TryingFallback --> Online: on_got_ip
    TryingFallback --> Off: deadline expires
    Off --> Provisioning: start_provisioning
    Provisioning --> Online: ProvisioningEvent::Connected
    Provisioning --> Off: stop_provisioning
    Online --> Reconnecting: on_disconnected (runtime)
    Reconnecting --> Online: on_got_ip
    Reconnecting --> Reconnecting: reconnect cycle fails
    Online --> Off: shutdown
    Reconnecting --> Off: shutdown
```

The service does not store an explicit state enum. State is reconstructed from
atomic online mirrors plus orchestrator-task-owned provisioning and deadline
fields. The diagram above is the intended lifecycle the orchestrator's policy
keys off.

### Saved-Credentials Connect

`connect_with_saved_credentials()` calls `WifiManager::connect()` with an
empty SSID. The manager interprets that as auto-connect from its saved
networks. One saved network is connected directly with normal retry/backoff;
multiple saved networks are scanned, ranked by RSSI, and tried with
single-attempt failover. The manager returns `WifiStatus::NotFound` when no
networks are saved. `NotFound` is converted to a synthetic
`WifiDisconnected{no_ap_found}` event so the orchestrator's normal disconnect
routing applies. Other non-OK statuses post a synthetic
`WifiDisconnected{unknown}`.

The initial-connect deadline is armed only when the manager accepts the
request (returns `Ok`). The deadline is single-writer: only
`shutdown()`, `connect_with_saved_credentials()`,
`try_default_fallback_credentials()`, and `tick()` mutate it. The IP
callback signals a pending clear via the `_clear_deadline_pending`
atomic, which the next `tick()` consumes — keeping the deadline write
off the Wi-Fi event-task thread.

### Factory-Default Fallback

`try_default_fallback_credentials()` connects with an explicit SSID, which
the manager always treats as a transient connect — the saved-networks store
is never written. (The HAL forces `WIFI_STORAGE_RAM` once at init, so
ESP-IDF never persists STA credentials either.) The attempt is single-shot
(`max_retry_count = 0`); if it fails or the fallback window expires the
disconnect policy opens provisioning.

### Runtime Reconnect

After the first successful IP (`has_been_online()` latched), a disconnect
is a _runtime_ event: the orchestrator calls `schedule_reconnect()`
instead of opening provisioning. The service arms a `reconnect_delay_ms`
(5 s) timer; when `tick()` fires it, the service re-issues the saved-
network connect through the shared `_connect_saved_internal()` helper
with `reset_online_latches = false` and `arm_window = false`. Preserving
the `has_been_online()` latch keeps subsequent delivered failures routing back
to the runtime branch (reconnect), never the bring-up provisioning branch.

Within each reconnect cycle the `WifiManager` applies its own retry /
backoff for retriable reasons (including `no_ap_found`); when it gives up
it emits a terminal disconnect, which schedules the next cycle. The fixed
inter-cycle delay also spaces out instant-fail reasons (`auth_failed`,
`assoc_failed`, `dhcp_failed`) so they cannot tight-loop the radio. Each
delivered terminal event schedules another cycle; runtime never intentionally
gives up or provisions. `schedule_reconnect()` is a no-op when no networks are
saved (a fallback-only session has nothing to reconnect to). Ordinary
connected/disconnected events use non-blocking central-queue sends and are not
retained, so queue saturation can skip endpoint activation or a reconnect
schedule.

**Tradeoff — delayed failover to a second saved network.** When the
connected AP dies, `WifiManager` first spends its full
`STATIONARY_MAX_RETRY_COUNT` (3) retry/backoff budget on the _latched
winning AP_ before emitting the terminal disconnect that triggers
`schedule_reconnect()`. Only the reconnect cycle re-scans and ranks all
saved networks, so a different saved SSID is not considered until that
budget is spent. The three configured retry delays total 7 seconds; connection
attempt latency is HAL-dependent, and the product then adds its 5-second
inter-cycle delay. The budget was lowered from 5 to 3 to shorten this path. This
still favours recovering the _same_ AP (e.g. a router reboot) over fast failover.
During that window `WifiManager` reports itself online, so the
status-bar Wi-Fi icon shows connected and cloud posts keep failing
(`Host is unreachable`); both flip once the terminal disconnect fires —
`on_wifi_disconnected()` disarms cloud and repaints the disconnected
glyph. Surfacing the L2 drop sooner (so the icon and cloud track the
outage immediately) would need a `WifiManager` link-down notification —
intentionally deferred.

The local routes and listener remain installed across a runtime STA outage.
`WifiManager` stops the `StaIpAuto` mDNS instance on link loss and restarts it
after got-IP. The orchestrator's reconnect activation calls are idempotent, so
they refresh RSSI and ensure discovery without re-registering routes or
restarting the listener.

### Local HTTP and mDNS

Local endpoint activation follows a strict order:

```text
LocalServer.begin routes -> HttpServer.start listener -> set/start local mDNS
```

`LocalServer::begin()` is transactional. A partial route-registration failure
unregisters the routes from that attempt and suppresses listener startup. If
listener startup fails after all routes register, `LocalServer::end()` rolls
them back. An mDNS failure is independent: HTTP stays active and admitted while
the orchestrator retries discovery every 5 s.

The local profile advertises `_airgradient._tcp` on `http_port` with hostname
`airgradient_<serial>` and TXT keys `vendor=AirGradient`, `model`, `serialno`,
`fw_ver`, and `api=1`. The profile uses `WifiMdnsLifecycle::StaIpAuto`, while
`ensure_local_mdns()` explicitly starts it for the current got-IP transition.

Before either saved-network or factory-fallback STA connection, `WifiService`
sets `WifiPowerSave::None`. ESP-IDF otherwise defaults to minimum modem power
saving, which can make multicast delivery unreliable after cached mDNS address
records expire. Stationary mode is wall-powered, so it prioritizes continuous
local discovery over modem-sleep savings. A failure to apply the policy is
logged but does not abort the connection attempt.

`start_provisioning()` first tears the local endpoint down so provisioning owns
its transport routes exclusively. Transport switches call provisioning stop
with `stop_http_server=false`, preserving the listener when one is already bound
while route ownership changes. On provisioning success, the orchestrator again
uses `stop_provisioning(false)`: Wi-Fi provisioning unregisters its routes while
retaining its listener. Directly started BLE-only provisioning has no listener,
while BLE-only reached through a Wi-Fi-to-BLE switch can inherit one. Local
routes then register before the idempotent listener start.

Full teardown uses the reverse ownership order: clear the mDNS profile (which
stops mDNS), stop the listener, unregister local routes, then disconnect and
turn Wi-Fi off. This also stops a listener retained by an interrupted
provisioning handoff.

### Provisioning Start

After clearing retained provisioning success and tearing down the local
endpoint, `start_provisioning()` calls `WifiManager::disconnect()`
unconditionally so any in-flight STA connect releases the Wi-Fi callback slots
cleanly. The call is idempotent — a `Disconnected` manager state
returns `Ok` without side effects, and an in-flight `Connecting` state
has its retry timer cancelled and its driver-echo disconnect swallowed
through `WifiManager`'s `_disconnect_requested` latch. The
`requested_by_user` event the manager emits on this path is ignored by
`WifiService::_on_disconnected()`.

`start_provisioning()` also zeros the initial-connect deadline before
handing the Wi-Fi callbacks to `ProvisioningManager::start()`. Without
this, a fast credential-class fail during the preceding STA attempt
could leave a stale armed deadline that fires mid-provisioning and
synthesizes an unwanted `WifiDisconnected{connection_lost}`.

When `_start_provisioning_internal()` succeeds the service marks
`_provisioning_active = true` and remembers the active transport.
`ProvisioningManager::set_on_event` is installed once at construction
and stays installed for the lifetime of the service.

### Transport Switching

`switch_provisioning_transport()` is implemented as back-to-back
`ProvisioningManager::stop(stop_http_server = false)` + `start()` with
the new transport. A `_switching_transport` latch swallows the
intermediate `Stopped` event so the orchestrator does not interpret the
switch-internal teardown as a user abort:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Orch as Orchestrator
    participant Svc as WifiService
    participant Prov as ProvisioningManager

    Orch->>Svc: switch_provisioning_transport
    Svc->>Svc: _switching_transport = true
    Svc->>Prov: stop(stop_http_server=false)
    Prov-->>Svc: Stopped (swallowed)
    Svc->>Prov: start(new transport)
    Prov-->>Svc: Started
    Svc->>Svc: _switching_transport = false
    Svc-->>Orch: ProvisioningStateChanged(Started, new transport)
```

`stop_http_server = false` keeps an already-bound borrowed HTTP listener across
the switch so the product does not pay a bind / unbind cycle. It does not create
a listener for BLE-only provisioning. The new transport's `_transport` value is
set before `start()` so any `Started` event fired during the inner start carries
the destination transport and not the stale source. If `_prov->start()` returns
false the service rolls `_transport` back, clears the latch, marks
`_provisioning_active = false`, and synthesizes a
`Stopped(ProductRequested)` so the orchestrator's existing
"Stopped before online -> change_mode(Portable)" rule rescues the user.

### Callback Ownership

`ProvisioningManager::start()` installs its own callbacks on the
borrowed `WifiManager` and `stop()` clears them. The service follows a
strict ownership rule:

- `WifiService` owns `on_got_ip` and `on_disconnected` at all times
  outside an active provisioning session.
- `ProvisioningManager` owns those slots while a session is active.
- `ProvisioningManager::set_on_event` is installed once by the
  constructor and never reassigned.

`stop_provisioning()` calls `_install_wifi_callbacks()` after the
component returns so post-online disconnects and `shutdown()` continue
to route through `WifiService`. `shutdown()` calls
`_detach_wifi_callbacks()` so the orchestrator never sees a callback
firing after the service has been told to tear down.

Fresh STA entry paths (`connect_with_saved_credentials()` and
`try_default_fallback_credentials()`) also call `_install_wifi_callbacks()`.
This restores callback ownership after a same-runtime
Stationary -> Portable -> Stationary cycle; without it ESP-IDF can acquire
an IP while the product service never sees `got_ip`, leaving the initial
connect deadline armed until it incorrectly opens provisioning.

While provisioning owns the Wi-Fi callback slot,
`ProvisioningEvent::Connected` is the online transition.
`_on_provisioning_event()` mirrors what `on_got_ip` would have latched
(`_ip`, `_online`, `_has_been_online`, `_rssi`) before forwarding the
event so the orchestrator's `has_been_online()` check reads true on the
subsequent `Stopped` teardown.

## Events

`WifiService` is the sole producer of three event types on the central
queue. All events are consumed by `Orchestrator::dispatch()`.

| EventType | Payload | Producer path |
|---|---|---|
| `WifiConnected` | `uint32_t wifi_ip` (network byte order) | `_on_got_ip()` after a successful STA association outside provisioning |
| `WifiDisconnected` | `uint8_t wifi_disconnect_reason` (`WifiDisconnectReason`) | `_on_disconnected()` for every reason except `requested_by_user`, plus synthetic `connection_lost` from `tick()` on deadline expiry and synthetic `no_ap_found` / `unknown` on connect rejection |
| `ProvisioningStateChanged` | `ProvisioningEventPayload prov` | `_on_provisioning_event()` for every `ProvisioningEvent`, minus the swallowed mid-switch `Stopped` |

`ProvisioningEventPayload` (`products/go/main/go_wifi_types.h`)
carries `disable_cloud` and `static_ip` inline so the orchestrator can
persist them without querying live service state after the event.
`static_ip` is zeroed when the user selected DHCP.

`Connected` is the only provisioning event retained on central queue
backpressure because losing it would strand the listener handoff. The callback
stores the complete event and `tick()` retries a non-blocking queue send until
one succeeds. Other provisioning events remain best-effort. A fresh
`start_provisioning()` and `shutdown()` clear any retained `Connected` event so
stale success cannot cross lifecycle boundaries.

## Timer Integration

The service owns the initial-connect / fallback deadline. The
orchestrator drives the clock:

```cpp
// In Orchestrator::compute_queue_timeout_ms()
uint32_t wifi_deadline = _svc.wifi.next_deadline_ms();
if (wifi_deadline != 0) {
    next = std::min(next, wifi_deadline - now);
}

// In Orchestrator::check_timers()
_svc.wifi.tick(static_cast<uint32_t>(RTOS::get_time_ms()));
```

`tick(now_ms)` first retries a retained provisioning `Connected` event, then
consumes `_clear_deadline_pending` (set by the IP
callback) to clear the armed connect-window deadline, then checks whether
it has expired without an IP. On expiry it posts a synthetic
`WifiDisconnected{connection_lost}` and the orchestrator's disconnect
policy opens provisioning. `tick()` then checks the separate runtime
reconnect timer and, on expiry, issues the saved-network reconnect.

The service holds two independent timers — the connect window and the
runtime reconnect timer — and `next_deadline_ms()` returns the nearer of
the two (treating 0 as "not armed"). The bring-up connect window and the
runtime reconnect timer are never armed at the same time: the window
belongs to a pre-online attempt, the reconnect to a post-online one.

The shutdown / connect / fallback paths all zero the connect deadline
before re-arming it, and `shutdown()` / `start_provisioning()` also zero
the reconnect timer. The result is a single-writer invariant: each timer
is mutated only by the orchestrator task, and cleared by the same task
that armed it.

## Edge Cases / Errors

- **No saved networks at boot.** `connect_with_saved_credentials()`
  short-circuits through `NotFound` and synthesizes a `no_ap_found`
  disconnect; the orchestrator opens provisioning per its before-online
  disconnect policy.
- **STA connect rejected by HAL.** Any non-OK / non-NotFound `connect`
  status synthesizes a `WifiDisconnected{unknown}`. The deadline is not
  armed (no spurious tick-driven event).
- **Fallback AP missing.** The fallback attempt has no auto-retry
  (`max_retry_count = 0`). On disconnect the orchestrator routes per
  policy; on timeout `tick()` synthesizes `connection_lost`.
- **`requested_by_user` disconnect.** Emitted by the manager during the
  service's own `disconnect()` / `shutdown()` path. Ignored explicitly
  in `_on_disconnected()`.
- **Mid-switch `Stopped` event.** Swallowed via `_switching_transport`
  latch so the orchestrator's "Stopped before online" rule does not
  bounce out of provisioning.
- **`start()` failure during transport switch.** Synthesizes a
  `Stopped(ProductRequested)` event so the orchestrator's existing
  fall-back-to-Portable rule rescues the user.
- **Late events after `shutdown()`.** Callbacks are detached in
  `shutdown()`, so no event posts after the service is torn down. The
  orchestrator also gates `on_wifi_connected()` and
  `on_wifi_disconnected()` on `_mode == Stationary` to ignore strays.
- **Cold-boot Stationary with no saved networks.** The board's
  `init_wifi_subsystem()` runs lazily on first `enter_stationary()`
  call; constructing `WifiService` against an uninitialized HAL is safe
  because the constructor only installs `std::function` callbacks.
- **Central queue full at provisioning success.** The complete `Connected`
  event is retained and retried from `tick()` until delivered once. Fresh
  provisioning and shutdown discard the retained copy.

## Notes

- The deadline write is single-writer by construction; the IP callback
  only signals a pending clear via `_clear_deadline_pending` instead of
  touching the deadline directly. This keeps the deadline value off the
  Wi-Fi event-task thread.
- Atomic state mirrors (`_online`, `_has_been_online`, `_ip`, `_rssi`,
  `_last_disconnect_reason`) allow lock-free reads from the orchestrator
  task without coordination with the event-task thread.
- `STATIONARY_MAX_RETRY_COUNT = 3` (file-local in `go_wifi.cpp`)
  bounds the auto-retry budget per saved-credentials connect cycle (both
  the bring-up attempt and each runtime reconnect cycle). Kept low so a
  runtime dead-AP drop reaches the terminal disconnect promptly.
  Provisioning overall timeout is disabled (`0`).
- Transport selection is not persisted; every Stationary entry starts
  on `ProvisioningTransport::BleOnly`.
- Provisioning lifecycle paths emit `log_heap()` probes around transport
  start, stop, and BLE / Wi-Fi transport switching. These are target-only
  diagnostics for tracking contiguous heap pressure during Stationary setup.
- **WiFi pull OTA** rides this Stationary link but is owned by the orchestrator,
  not `WifiService`. The orchestrator gates its hourly OTA check on
  `is_online() && !_setup_session_active && !_settings.disable_cloud`, pauses
  cloud around it, and never runs it concurrently with provisioning or a
  download. A mid-download Wi-Fi drop surfaces as the OTA source read failing
  (`TransportError`). A disconnect queued during a speculative check survives;
  during a committed transfer, the exit queue drain can discard it, so automatic
  reconnect is not guaranteed after a non-rebooting terminal. See
  [`ota_service.md`](ota_service.md) and
  [`orchestrator.md` → OTA](orchestrator.md#firmware-update-ota).

## Testability

`WifiService` is host-testable via friend-class access
(`WifiServiceTestAccess`) and link-time stubs for `WifiManager`,
`ProvisioningManager`, `AgBleServer`, and `HttpServer`. Host tests live
in `products/go/tests/go_wifi.tests.cpp` and cover:

- Saved-credentials connect, including `NotFound` synthesizing a
  disconnect, deadline arming, and the IP callback latching the
  deferred clear.
- Factory-default fallback connect (transient, never saved), single-shot
  retry budget, and deadline expiry synthesizing `connection_lost`.
- Provisioning start (cancels in-flight STA, zeros deadlines, installs
  config), stop (reinstalls Wi-Fi callbacks), and switch (swallows the
  intermediate `Stopped`, synthesizes one on start failure).
- Online latches around `ProvisioningEvent::Connected` so
  `has_been_online()` reads true on the subsequent `Stopped`.
- Runtime reconnect: `schedule_reconnect()` arms the reconnect timer,
  `tick()` issues the saved connect without resetting `has_been_online()`,
  the no-op when no networks are saved, and `next_deadline_ms()` returning
  the nearer of the two timers.
- Shutdown path (detaches callbacks, zeroes latches, sets mode `Off`).
