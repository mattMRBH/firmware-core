# Display Service

Product-specific display service for AirGradient Go. Manages e-paper rendering
via u8g2, three-tier refresh decisions (full/fast/partial), and an async worker
task for SPI hardware refresh. The orchestrator calls the Display Service API
which returns immediately; the slow EPD refresh runs in a dedicated task.

## Display Hardware

**Panel:** Good Display GDEY0213B74, 128x250 px, 1-bit monochrome (SSD1680).
**Interface:** SPI half-duplex, mode 0, 4 MHz, CS managed manually.
**SPI bus:** Shared with NAND flash on SPI2_HOST; uses
`spi_device_acquire_bus(portMAX_DELAY)` for exclusive access during display
operations (ESP-IDF only supports infinite wait for bus acquisition).

All pin assignments come from `board_config.h` via `Config` struct members.

## Public API

### DisplayService::Config

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spi_host` | `spi_host_device_t` | (required) | SPI bus host |

### Methods

| Method | Blocking | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `init(initial, defer_refresh=false)` | Depends | Init driver + u8g2, render initial frame. See below. |
| `update(values, wait)` | No* | Render frame, signal worker. `wait=true` blocks until any prior worker job clears so the new frame queues without being dropped (does **not** wait for the new frame to finish painting; use `flush()` for that). |
| `update_sync(values)` | Yes | Render + SPI inline; for fast-path boot without worker |
| `flush()` | Yes | Spin until `_worker_busy` clears so the most-recently-queued frame is fully painted. Cheap polling with `RTOS::delay_ms(1)`, mirroring `clear()` / `stop()`. Used by every session transition that gates a fixed-duration on-screen dwell (the 500 ms STA `Connected!` hold, the 1.5 s provisioning `Connected!` hold, the `SwitchingTransport` ack, both leave-session renders). MUST NOT be called from the display worker task itself. |
| `clear()` | Yes | Clear display to white via full refresh |
| `deep_sleep()` | Yes | Put SSD1680 into deep sleep mode 1 (~100 µA → <1 µA) |
| `stop()` | Yes | Stop worker task; call before ESP deep sleep |

#### `init()` — `defer_refresh` parameter

```cpp
bool init(const DisplayValues &initial, bool defer_refresh = false);
```

| `defer_refresh` | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `false` (default) | Synchronous: renders frame, performs full SPI refresh (~3 s), then starts worker. Used by `run_interactive()` and `run_fast_path()`. |
| `true` | Deferred: renders frame into buffer, copies to SPI buffer, marks full refresh pending, starts worker and immediately signals it to run the initial refresh in the background. Returns in ~10 ms. |

When `defer_refresh=true`, `init()` returns before the SPI refresh begins.
The worker task acquires the SPI bus and holds it for the duration of the
refresh (~3 s). Any other SPI device that calls `spi_device_transmit()` during
this window (e.g. NAND flash) blocks until the worker releases the bus —
natural serialization without an explicit semaphore.

`_worker_busy` is set to `true` before the worker starts so that a concurrent
`update()` call will not corrupt the in-progress refresh.

## RTC Display Snapshot

`RtcDisplaySnapshot` is a flat struct of scalar fields (no pointers) stored in
RTC slow memory so it survives deep sleep. It is saved by
`prepare_for_sleep()` just before the device enters deep sleep, and loaded by
`run_button_wake_path()` at the very start of a button-wake boot.

```cpp
struct RtcDisplaySnapshot {
  // Sensor values
  int   co2_ppm;          float pm25_ugm3;
  float temperature_c;    float humidity_pct;
  int   tvoc_index;       int   nox_index;
  float pressure_hpa;     float altitude_m;
  // Battery
  uint8_t battery_pct;  bool is_battery_charging;
  // Status flags & rendering settings
  bool gps_enabled;  bool gps_fix;  bool tracking_active;  bool ble_enabled;
  bool use_fahrenheit;  bool pm_use_usaqi;
};
```

Estimated size: ~40 bytes (well within the ~50 B budget; total RTC usage
~1.6 KB of the 8 KB available on ESP32-C5).

### Free functions

```cpp
// Save the last displayed state to RTC memory (go_display.cpp).
// Called from prepare_for_sleep() after the final display update.
void save_rtc_display_snapshot(const DisplayValues &values);

// Load the snapshot saved before the last deep sleep.
// Returns true and fills *snapshot_out when valid; false on first power-on.
bool load_rtc_display_snapshot(RtcDisplaySnapshot *snapshot_out);
```

Both functions are declared in `go_display.h` within the `#ifndef TEST_HOST`
guard, with inline no-op stubs in the `#else` branch so the orchestrator
compiles cleanly in host test builds.

The validity flag (`s_rtc_display_snapshot_valid`) is zero-initialized in RTC
memory on first power-on, so an uninitialized snapshot is never used. When
the snapshot is invalid, `build_wake_values()` fills the `DisplayValues` with
the default invalid sentinels, and the renderer shows dashes.

## Host-Compatible Types

`Screen`, `Metric`, `ListRow`, `DisplayValues`, and `RtcDisplaySnapshot` are
defined outside the `#ifndef TEST_HOST` guard and compile without ESP-IDF
headers. `DisplayService` and the snapshot free functions are
hardware-dependent and excluded from host builds (stubs provided).

### Screen Enum

| Screen | Notes |
|---|---|
| `Home` | Dashboard |
| `MainMenu` | Home with menu overlay |
| `Settings` / `SettingsChoice` / `TagList` / `About` / `Confirm` | Full-screen lists |
| `Shutdown` | Powering off |
| `PairingPasskey` | 6-digit BLE passkey, set by orchestrator |
| `Info` | Generic single-text presentation surface (Stationary bring-up narration); no status bar, no snackbar |
| `Provisioning` | Stationary Wi-Fi provisioning page (QR + status + action rows); no status bar, no snackbar |
| `ProvisioningConfirm` | Yes / No confirmation overlay for Provisioning actions; no status bar, no snackbar |

The three Stationary setup screens (`Info`, `Provisioning`,
`ProvisioningConfirm`) form one logical "setup session". They share a
distinct refresh policy and own the full canvas (no status bar drawn).
See [Setup Session Refresh Policy](#setup-session-refresh-policy) below.

### DisplayValues

Flat snapshot of everything needed to render one frame. Built by the UI Manager
on every update; the Display Service diffs against the previous snapshot
internally to select the refresh tier (Full/Fast/Partial).

Key points:

- TVOC/NOx are `int` (SGP41 algorithm index output, not raw resistance)
- Sensor readings come from channel A (`pm_a`, `temp_hum_a`)
- `ListRow::text` is `char[48]` (owned by struct, not a pointer)
- Invalid sentinels from `MeasuresInvalid`; `0xFF` for battery
- `ble_passkey` (`uint32_t`): 6-digit passkey for PairingPasskey screen
- `info_text` (`const char *`): caller-owned ASCII string for `Screen::Info`; null or empty renders a blank canvas
- `provisioning_status` (`const char *`): transport-aware status text for `Screen::Provisioning`; auto-wrapped to at most 2 lines so long strings (`Connected! 192.168.x.y`, `Connect failed - try again`) stay inside the canvas
- `provisioning_transport` (`uint8_t`): `ProvisioningTransport` value driving transport-specific labels and captions
- `provisioning_connected_ip` (`uint32_t`): network-byte-order IPv4 (low byte = first octet) matching `WifiGotIpCallback`, `WifiStaticIpConfig`, and `format_ipv4_be`. Non-zero overrides the status line with the formatted `Connected!` text via `UIManager::provisioning_status_text()`
- `provisioning_confirm_kind` (`uint8_t`): `0` switch transport, `1` cancel setup
- `provisioning_confirm_index` (`uint8_t`): `0` No (default), `1` Yes
- `provisioning_ap_ssid` (`const char *`): captive-portal AP SSID (`airgradient-<MAC>`) rendered as the Wi-Fi instruction line
- `provisioning_ap_password` (`const char *`): captive-portal AP password rendered as the Wi-Fi instruction line (sourced from `UIManager::Config::ap_password`, matches `WifiService::Config::ap_password`)
- `provisioning_qr` (`const AirgradientProvisioning::QrCode *`): borrowed pointer to the QR matrix shown on the Provisioning page. UIManager re-encodes on session entry and transport switch (BleOnly → companion-app URL, WifiOnly → `WIFI:` join descriptor). Null or empty matrix skips the QR area

## Architecture

### Dual-Buffer Pattern

| Buffer | Size | Context | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `_render_buf[4096]` | 4096 B | Orchestrator thread | u8g2 render target |
| `_spi_buf[4096]` | 4096 B | Worker task | SPI transmit source |
| `_region_buf[3712]` | 3712 B | Worker task | Body region for partial writes |

On each `update()`, the render buffer is `memcpy`'d to the SPI buffer before
signaling the worker. The orchestrator can re-render freely without corrupting
an in-progress SPI transfer.

### Async Worker Task

The worker task waits on an RTOS task notification, then drives the SPI
hardware. The orchestrator signals frame-ready via `RTOS::task_notify_give()`.
A `volatile bool _worker_busy` flag allows the orchestrator to check if the
worker is available (`wait=false` returns false if busy; `wait=true` spins
until ready).

In the deferred-refresh mode (`defer_refresh=true`), `init()` itself signals
the worker with the initial full-refresh job before returning. This means the
first `RTOS::task_notify_give()` comes from the main task inside `init()`,
not from `update()`. The worker processes this exactly like any other full
refresh, acquiring and releasing the SPI bus normally.

### Display Driver

The SSD1680 display driver is file-local (anonymous namespace in
`go_display.cpp`). It follows the SPI protocol documented in
`UI-IMPLEMENTATION.md` sections 2.3-2.4:

- `driver_init()` — GPIO setup, SPI device attachment, DMA bounce buffer
- `driver_hw_init_full()` — Full SSD1680 init (SW reset, gate config, RAM window)
- `driver_set_basemap()` — Write frame to both RAM planes + full update trigger (`0xF7`)
- `driver_hw_init_fast()` — Fast refresh init: SW reset + temperature override trick (forces 100 °C OTP LUT for faster waveform)
- `driver_fast_write()` — Write full frame to both RAM planes (basemap coherence for subsequent partials)
- `driver_fast_commit()` — Trigger fast update (`0xC7` waveform, non-differential, no flash)
- `driver_part_begin/write_region/commit()` — Partial update protocol (`0xFF` waveform, differential)
- `driver_deep_sleep()` — SSD1680 deep sleep mode 1
- `driver_bus_acquire/release()` — Exclusive SPI bus access

## Three-Tier Display Refresh

The display uses three refresh tiers to balance image quality, speed, and
user experience. See `products/go/specs/display_refresh_tiers.md` for the
full design rationale.

### RefreshMode Enum

```cpp
enum class RefreshMode : uint8_t {
    Full,     ///< Full GC waveform (flash). Resets basemap in both RAM planes.
    Fast,     ///< Full-screen 0xC7 waveform (no flash). Temperature-override trick.
    Partial,  ///< Body-only differential 0xFF (no flash). Writes body region only.
};
```

### Refresh Tiers

| Tier | SSD1680 Waveform | Duration | Flash | When |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Full** | `0xF7` (GC, both RAM planes) | ~2–3 s | Yes | Init from deep sleep; anti-ghosting after 20 differential ops |
| **Fast** | `0xC7` (non-differential, 100 °C OTP LUT) | ~1–1.5 s | No | Transitions to/from PairingPasskey or Shutdown; navigable screen transitions with header change |
| **Partial** | `0xFF` (differential, body region only) | ~0.3–0.5 s | No | Menu navigation between navigable screens (header unchanged); same list screen updates |

### Decision Logic

The `update()` method selects the refresh mode using this priority:

1. **Full** — crossing the setup-session boundary (any non-session screen
   ↔ `Info` / `Provisioning` / `ProvisioningConfirm`). Resets
   `_diff_count` and `_menu_exited` so the next session starts with a
   fresh partial budget.
2. **Partial** — in-session transition (both previous and next are
   session screens). The partial-op counter is **not** consulted inside
   the session. Covers `Info` text updates, Provisioning status updates,
   `Provisioning ↔ ProvisioningConfirm`, and No ↔ Yes toggling.
3. **Partial** — menu-navigation transition (either previous or next is
   a menu-navigation screen, and the next screen is not Shutdown or
   PairingPasskey)
4. **Full** — `_diff_count >= max_partial_ops` (anti-ghosting, default 20)
5. **Fast** — `_menu_exited` is set (post-menu cleanup)
6. **Partial** — both screens "navigable" and header unchanged, OR same
   list screen
7. **Fast** — everything else (fallback)

A screen is **navigable** if the user reaches it through normal menu
interaction: Home, MainMenu, Settings, SettingsChoice, TagList, Confirm,
About. PairingPasskey and Shutdown are not navigable — transitions involving
them always use Fast for clear visual indication.

A screen is **menu-navigation** if it is navigable and not Home (MainMenu,
Settings, SettingsChoice, TagList, Confirm, About). Transitions where either
side is a menu-navigation screen force body-only Partial regardless of header
changes or anti-ghosting counter. This keeps menu interaction responsive and
flash-free. The anti-ghosting Full refresh is deferred, not skipped.

`_menu_exited` is set during any menu-navigation Partial and cleared when a
full-screen refresh (Full or Fast) executes. After the user leaves the menu,
the first non-menu update triggers Fast (or Full if the anti-ghosting
threshold was reached during the menu session) to clean up accumulated
artifacts and refresh the status bar.

All non-Shutdown screens share the same status bar at Y=0..17. Partial
updates write the body region only (Y=18..249, 232 px height, full 128 px
width), so the status bar is physically unchanged on the display. Header
changes during menu navigation and same-list-screen interactions are silently
deferred; the header self-corrects at the post-menu cleanup refresh or the
next Full refresh (anti-ghosting).

### Anti-Ghosting Counter

`_diff_count` counts all differential operations (both Fast and Partial).
Both waveform types accumulate ghosting equally on the GDEY0213B74 panel.
The counter resets to 0 on Full refresh and uses saturating increment on Fast
or Partial (capped at `UINT8_MAX` to prevent wrap during long menu sessions).
`Config::max_partial_ops` (default 20) controls the limit.

During menu navigation, the anti-ghosting threshold may be reached or
exceeded, but the menu-navigation rule (tier 1) overrides it. The counter
keeps incrementing. When a later non-menu update runs, `_diff_count >=
max_partial_ops` (tier 2) promotes it to Full — an even stronger cleanup
than the Fast from `_menu_exited`.

### Fast Refresh: Temperature Override

The Fast tier uses a vendor-documented technique for the GDEY0213B74 panel:

1. SW reset clears all SSD1680 registers
2. Read the built-in temperature sensor, then override the temperature
   register to 100 °C (`0x64`)
3. Reload the OTP LUT — the controller selects a faster, more aggressive
   waveform designed for high-temperature operation
4. Re-establish display geometry (data entry mode, RAM windows, cursor)
5. Write full frame to both RAM planes (0x24 and 0x26 — ensures basemap
   coherence for subsequent Partial refreshes)
6. Trigger with `0xC7` (skips LUT loading since it was done in step 3)

Writing both RAM planes ensures that after a Fast refresh, the basemap
(RAM 0x26) matches the displayed content. Subsequent Partial refreshes
(which diff 0x24 vs 0x26) produce correct results.

### Decision Matrix

| Condition | Refresh Mode |
|---|---|
| Crossing the setup-session boundary (non-session ↔ Info / Provisioning / ProvisioningConfirm) | Full |
| In-session transition (Info ↔ Provisioning ↔ ProvisioningConfirm, including same-screen text updates) | Partial |
| Menu-navigation transition (prev or next is menu-nav screen) | Partial |
| Menu-navigation transition, even if `diff_count >= max_partial_ops` | Partial |
| Menu-navigation transition with header change | Partial |
| Transition **to** Shutdown or PairingPasskey from menu | Fast/Full (existing) |
| `diff_count >= max_partial_ops` (non-menu, non-session) | Full |
| Post-menu cleanup (`_menu_exited` set, non-menu update) | Fast |
| Both navigable, header unchanged (non-menu, non-session) | Partial |
| Same list screen (any header state) | Partial |
| Screen transition involving PairingPasskey (non-menu) | Fast |
| Screen transition involving Shutdown (non-menu) | Fast |
| Navigable screen transition, header changed (non-menu, non-session) | Fast |

### Setup Session Refresh Policy

`Screen::Info`, `Screen::Provisioning`, and `Screen::ProvisioningConfirm`
are treated as one logical setup session. The refresh policy has two
rules layered on top of the general matrix:

- **Crossing the session boundary in either direction forces Full.**
  Any non-session screen entering a session screen, or any session
  screen returning to Home / Portable, runs a full GC waveform. This
  prevents the prior layout from ghosting under the new one. The
  partial-op counter and `_menu_exited` flag are reset at the boundary.
- **All intra-session transitions are Partial, regardless of layout
  change.** This includes `Info` text updates
  (`Connecting to saved Wi-Fi...` → `Trying default Wi-Fi...` →
  `Connected!\n<ip>`), Provisioning status updates, the
  `Provisioning ↔ ProvisioningConfirm` overlay, the No ↔ Yes toggle in
  the confirmation overlay, and the in-session `Info → Provisioning`
  jump. The partial worker writes the **full canvas** (y = 0..249) for
  session screens, so even visually-disjoint layouts (Info's centered
  text block versus Provisioning's full-canvas QR layout) clear
  cleanly without falling back to the Full waveform's ~3 s flash.

Non-session partials still write only the body region (y = 18..249,
232 px tall) to preserve the status bar without rewriting it. The
selection between body-only and full-canvas partial happens in the
worker loop based on `is_session_screen(_prev_values.screen)`.

### Session-Screen Drawing

Session screens skip `_draw_status_bar()` and `_draw_snackbar()`:

- `_draw_info()` renders a centered word-wrapped text block in the
  body region (y ≥ 18 clamp). Uses `compute_wrapped_lines()` with a
  `u8g2_GetStrWidth` closure as the `StrWidthFn`, ASCII only, font
  `u8g2_font_helvB12_tf`. Multi-line text honours explicit `\n` as
  hard breaks and word-wraps each paragraph at the last space
  boundary that fits.
- `_draw_provisioning()` renders the title (`Connect to Wi-Fi`),
  transport-specific QR code (drawn from `v.provisioning_qr` —
  encoded by UIManager: companion-app URL for BLE, Wi-Fi `WIFI:` join
  descriptor for the captive-portal AP), caption, instructions
  (SSID + password from `v.provisioning_ap_ssid` /
  `v.provisioning_ap_password` in Wi-Fi), status line (auto-wrapped to
  at most 2 lines via the same word-wrap helper), helper text, and
  two action rows. Labels switch on `provisioning_transport`. Module
  pixel size and quiet zone are product-local; the QR matrix data
  comes from `airgradient-provisioning`.
- `_draw_provisioning_confirm()` renders the question text from
  `v.rows[0].text` (provided by `UIManager::populate_provisioning_confirm_rows()`)
  and two filled / framed buttons (`No` index 0, `Yes` index 1)
  driven by `provisioning_confirm_index`.

### Display Update Suppression

Background display updates are suppressed in two cases:

- **Menu-navigation screens** (MainMenu, Settings, SettingsChoice,
  TagList, Confirm, About). Background events — sensor data, BLE
  connect/disconnect/auth/config writes, BMS charging-status changes,
  and snackbar expiry — do not trigger display updates while the user
  is interacting with a menu.
- **Setup session screens** (`Info`, `Provisioning`,
  `ProvisioningConfirm`). The orchestrator's
  `_setup_session_active` flag short-circuits
  `request_background_display_update()` entirely so sensor / BMS /
  BLE-status events that arrive during the session do not race the
  explicit `update_display(wait=true)` calls that drive session state
  transitions.

Both cases are enforced by the orchestrator's
`request_background_display_update()`, which checks
`_setup_session_active` first, then delegates to
`UIManager::is_on_menu_screen()`. Background data is still cached
internally and pushed to BLE clients; only the e-paper refresh is
suppressed. The display catches up on the next user-initiated repaint
or on the next deliberate session render. See `docs/orchestrator.md`
for the full call-site classification.

## Rendering Pipeline

Frame assembly order:

1. Clear buffer to 0xFF (white)
2. Set draw color to 0 (black)
3. If Shutdown: `draw_shutdown()` + `draw_snackbar()`
4. Else: `draw_status_bar()` + screen-specific draw + `draw_snackbar()`

Screen dispatch:

- **Home:** Hero blocks (PM2.5, CO2 with dual-font labels centered via
  `u8g2_GetStrWidth()`) + 3-row grid (Temp/Humidity, TVOC/NOx or
  Min/Max, Pressure/Altitude or chart). Grid dividers span full 128 px;
  1st divider is always 2 px thick, 3rd is 2 px thick when chart is
  visible. Selection rects for PM2.5, CO2, Temp, and Humidity use full
  128 px width. Logo removed from home page (kept for display-off and
  shutdown only).
- **MainMenu:** Home screen (metric cleared to None) + overlay at y=162.
  The 2 px-thick 1st grid divider is preserved as the menu top border.
  Menu rows use full 128 px-wide selection rects.
- **Settings/SettingsChoice/TagList/Confirm/About:** Full-screen list with
  full 128 px-wide selection rects and vertically centered text. A
  separator line between the header rows (Exit/Back) and content rows
  uses a 2 px content offset to avoid touching.
- **PairingPasskey:** "Bluetooth Pairing" title + large 6-digit passkey + instruction
- **Shutdown:** "Powering off..." message + "See you soon" + logo
