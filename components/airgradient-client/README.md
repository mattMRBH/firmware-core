# airgradient-client

Unified AirGradient server client. One `AgClient` object handles config fetch,
measure post, MQTT, and CoAP traffic against the AirGradient backend over a
single transport chosen at boot.

## Status

`Experimental`

Implemented and verified end-to-end:

- `NetworkType::Wifi` initialisation
- `http_fetch_config()` and `http_post_measures()` with full
  response-code mapping to `AgClientResult`

Other public methods (CoAP, MQTT, cellular `begin()`) are stubbed; see
[Not Yet Implemented](#not-yet-implemented).

## Scope

This component owns:

- AG-server URL construction and response code interpretation
- `Measures` → JSON serialization (with dual-channel averaging) for the
  HTTP path
- Protocol-client interfaces (`HttpClient`, `MqttClient`, `CoapClient`)
- WiFi HTTP backend (`WifiHttpClient`) over `esp_http_client`
- Vendored `coap-packet` and `payload-encoder` libraries (held for the
  future cellular CoAP backend)

This component does not own:

- Network bring-up (WiFi stack must be ready before `http_*` calls)
- Config parsing (returns the raw JSON body to the caller)
- OTA binary download (future `airgradient-ota` component)

## Public Includes

```cpp
#include "services/ag_client.h"
#include "types/client_types.h"
```

The `clients/` interfaces and `backends/` are internal: callers never
instantiate them directly.

Callers pass their `Measures`, `MeasuresBasic`, or `MeasuresAGo` value
directly; `AgClient` provides one overload per variant for each
measure-taking method, so no conversion happens at the call site.

## Design

```text
caller -> AgClient -> HttpClient (interface) -> WifiHttpClient -> esp_http_client
                   -> CoapClient (interface) -> (future cellular backend)
                   -> MqttClient (interface) -> (future backend)
```

`AgClient` builds URLs, serializes measures to JSON, and maps transport +
status outcomes to `AgClientResult` (`Ok`, `BufferTooSmall`,
`TransportError`, `ServerError`, `NotRegistered`). The protocol-specific
interfaces are the mock seam for host tests.

## Usage

```cpp
AgClient client;
if (!client.begin("aabbccddeeff", NetworkType::Wifi)) {
    // handle init failure
}

// Value-initialisation is safe: every measure substruct in
// measures_types.h default-initialises its fields to the matching
// MeasuresInvalid sentinel, so any field the caller does not set is
// omitted by the serializer.
MeasuresBasic m{};
m.temp_hum_a.temperature = 23.5f;

if (client.http_post_measures(m, -55) == AgClientResult::Ok) {
    // shipped
}
```

The same call works with `Measures` (full) and `MeasuresAGo` via
overloads — the appropriate overload is selected at the call site by
type.

## Configuration

| Symbol | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CONFIG_AG_CLIENT_CELLULAR_SUPPORT` | `n` | Reserved for future cellular work |

The Measures variant is picked per call site by the overload the caller
chooses — there is no compile-time variant selector for this component.

## Dependencies

- `components/airgradient-common/` — `Measures` types and `AG_LOG*` macros
- `esp_http_client` — WiFi HTTP backend
- `json` — bundled cJSON for JSON serialization

## Tests

Host tests live in `components/airgradient-client/tests/` and run through
the top-level [tests runner](../../tests/README.md). They use a friend
class (`AgClientTestAccess`) to inject a hand-rolled `MockHttpClient`.

## Validation

End-to-end smoke test:
[`products/reference/main/test_airgradient_client.cpp`](../../products/reference/main/test_airgradient_client.cpp).
Brings up WiFi, then runs three cases against the live backend and
verifies each `AgClientResult` mapping:

| Scenario | fetch_config | post_measures |
|---|---|---|
| Registered SN, valid domain | `Ok` | `Ok` |
| Unregistered SN, valid domain | `NotRegistered` | `ServerError` |
| Valid SN, unresolvable domain | `TransportError` | `TransportError` |

The `429 -> Ok` (rate-limited) and `BufferTooSmall` mappings are not
reachable deterministically on hardware and rely on the host tests.

## Not Yet Implemented

The following methods are present on `AgClient`'s public API so call
sites can be wired today, but they currently fail loudly. The full
design for each lives in [`spec.md`](spec.md), which will be deleted
once this work lands.

- `begin(sn, NetworkType::Cellular, modem)` — returns `false` and logs
- `coap_fetch_config()` / `coap_post_measures()` — abort
- `mqtt_connect()` / `mqtt_disconnect()` / `mqtt_publish_measures()` —
  abort
- Any `http_*` call when `begin()` was given `NetworkType::Cellular` —
  aborts (HTTP is WiFi-only by design)

The `coap-packet` and `payload-encoder` libraries are vendored in
`lib/` ahead of the cellular CoAP implementation; they compile but
nothing in the active code path uses them yet.

## Notes

- Calling a method whose backend is not yet implemented aborts with a
  clear error log. This is by design — it surfaces programming bugs
  early rather than silently no-op'ing.
- The previous library's `airgradient-client` (in `tmp/`) is being
  replaced by this component. Once consumers migrate,
  `tmp/airgradient-client/` can be removed.
