/**
 * @brief Sensirion SCD41 CO2 sensor adapter
 *
 * Wraps the shared `embedded-i2c-scd4x` Sensirion driver and adapts it to the
 * `CO2Sensor` interface used by the rest of the firmware. Runs the sensor in
 * periodic-measurement mode (5 s update interval) and exposes the integrated
 * temperature and humidity readings via `supports_temp_hum()` /
 * `temp_hum_data()`.
 *
 * Raw data is already converted to physical units by the Sensirion driver:
 * - CO2: ppm (uint16)
 * - Temperature: milli-degrees Celsius (int32)
 * - Humidity: milli-percent RH (int32)
 *
 * Calibration is implemented via Sensirion's Forced Recalibration (FRC):
 * do_baseline_calibration() stops periodic measurement, issues the FRC
 * command synchronously, restarts periodic measurement and returns the
 * overall success. The base-class is_baseline_calibration_done() default
 * (always true) matches the synchronous semantic, so no override is needed.
 * The caller must have operated the sensor in periodic measurement mode for
 * at least 3 minutes in a stable CO2 environment before invoking FRC.
 *
 * @note Singleton constraint: the underlying `embedded-i2c-scd4x` component
 *       keeps the I2C bus handle and the I2C device address in file-scope
 *       globals. Only one `SCD4x` instance can be used at a time. Constructing
 *       a second instance (even on a different bus) will rebind those globals
 *       and break the first instance.
